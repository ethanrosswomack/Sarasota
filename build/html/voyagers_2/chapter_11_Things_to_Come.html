      As Earth approaches its half-point in the second ascension cycle of its
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>26,556-year Euiago time cycle, the opportunity for ascension of human popu-
lations through the Halls of Amenti and into HU-2 is presented. Taking
advantage of this time-cycle placement opportunity, with Guardian assis-
tance, Earth can be shifted out of the range of Intruder Visitor manipulation,
through the Bridge Zone time continuum shift. The dynamics by which these
changes will occur are highly scienti fic, and involve complex interdimen-
sional physics mechanics. We have provided extensive information concern-
ing humanity’s need to evolve the DNA in order to accommodate these
changes, attempting to assist you in understanding the concept of the interre-
lationship of biological, spiritual and planetary evolution.<br />
The ﬁnal aspect of these interdimensional evolutionary/ascension dynamics
with which you need  to  become acquainted, is the mechanics of  Transmutative
Stellar Activations  and Stellar Wave Infusions , for it is through these mechan-
ics that personal and planetary ascension takes place.  In the Appendix we pro-
vide a brief introduction to Stellar Activations (page 464) and Stellar Wave
Infusion Mechanics (page 466). For now, we would simply like you to under-
stand that Earth and the human populations will be facing a series of six
Transmutative Stellar Activations and Stellar Wave Infusions between 5/5/
2000 and 2017. Through these Stellar Activations and Wave Infusions
Earth’s particle base will be temporarily raised into the pulsation rhythms of
the HU-2 time cycles, so grid merger between Earth and Tara, and the open-
ing of the Amenti ascension passages, can take place.<br />
These energy dynamics will affect the planetary grid and the physical and
bio-energetic systems of humans directly, so it is wise that you become aware
of these coming events. For this reason we have included the progression of
Stellar Spiral Alignments, Stellar Activations  and Stellar Wave Infusions
with our running schedule of upcoming Earthly events. The Six Stellar Acti-<br />

<p>vations, Stellar Wave Infusions and Stellar Spiral alignments Earth will
encounter between 2000 and 2017 are as follows:</p>

The following chronology of events also includes the Activation and
Infusion schedules for the Keepers of the Blue Flame and the Keepers of the
Violet Flame. Many of you reading this book may have hidden soul agree-
ments to serve as a Keeper of the Blue or Violet Flames. The Flame Keepers
are a specialized soul group that carries the Celestial Silicate Matrix gene
code, who incarnate during various time periods to assist the Palaidorians of
HU-2 with the human evolutionary process. Flame Keepers possess special-
ized genetic codes that will allow them to hold UHF within their bodies to
assist Earth with the Stellar Activation process. These writings represent a
“wake-up call” to the Flame Keepers, it is time for them to remember their
higher calling. Those of you who feel drawn to the concept of the Flame
Keepers are likely to be members of the Blue or Violet Flame soul groups. The
Keepers of the Blue Flame (Tara’s HU-2, D-5 morphogenetic field) begin and
complete their Stellar Activations and Infusions just prior to Earth’s Activa-

THE AMENTI ASCENSION PROGRAM SCHEDULE
6/1998 to 2017                                                                                         Transcendence Day
1.    June 26, 1998: Sphere of Amenti Continues to Transmit D-3 Frequen-
cies into Earth’s Core. The Morphogenetic Wave Begins to Build. Earth
Prepares for 1/1/2000 Transcendence Day. Flame Keepers Begin Blue
Wave Infusions.<br />
By 7/1998 the Sphere of Amenti opened into Earth’s morphogenetic field
six (out of 12) D-3 frequencies and it will proceed to transmit its remain-
ing six D-3 frequencies into Earth’s core between 7/1998 and 1/ 1/2000.
On 1/1/2000 Amenti will begin transmitting D-4 frequency through
Earth’s grid. The morphogenetic wave began to build on 6/26/1998 and
the D-4 Solar Spiral began to align with Earth, following the birth of Ava-
tar 3 and the sparking of the second seal on the Arc of the Covenant. Fol-
lowing the 6/26/1998 opening of the second seal on the Arc of the
Covenant, Blue Wave Infusions began within the bio-energetic fields of
the Keepers of the Blue and Violet Flame, as they assembled half of the
fourth DNA strand, halfway through their Solar Activation that began in
6/1996. The Flame Keepers will complete their Solar Activation on 1/1/
2000, in preparation for Earth’s Solar Activation on 5/5/2000. The Blue
Wave Infusio ns of the Flame Keepers will complete in 1/2002.
2.   August 30-September 1, 1998: Incubation Rite for Humans with
Palaidorian Birthing Contracts Took Place in Agartha. Contract Bonds
Were Activated.
Humans with Palaidorian Birthing Contract and Contract Bond soul
agreements were taken in their astral bodies to Agartha, by the Priests of
Ur . Those accepting their contracts to birth the Indigo children were
given the Contract Bond Incubation Rite, through which the soul matri-
ces of each parent couple were energetically merged and the Birthing
Contract was programmed into their operating genetic code.The
Palaidorian Birthing Contracts became finalized, non-transferable and
irreversible following the Contract Bond activation through the Incuba-
tion Rite.

<p>Due to the Guardians’ D-4 energy infusions into Earth’s core (which
began in 196 BC) and the opening of the second seal on the Arc of the
Covenant, with the birth of Avatar 3 on 6/26/1998, the Earth’s core parti-
cle pulsation speed raised high enough to begin preparation for Earth’s
Solar Activation on 5/5/2000. These frequency infusions have suf ficiently
increased the particle pulsation rhythm of Earth’s D-2 core and elemental
particle field, and Earth’s D-3 atmospheric particle field. Further D-4 fre-
quencies will be able to run through Earth’s D-2 and D-3 particle bases on
1/1/2000, when the D-4 Solar Spiral begins to align with Earth’s core. D-4
is a primary base tone dimension and D-2 is a primary overtone dimension
within the 15-dimensional scale. When the full D-4 frequency spectrum
of the Solar Spiral begins to permeate Earth’s D-2 core and elemental par-
ticle field on 1/1/2000, an interdimensional Resonant Tone  will be struck
as D-2 overtone and D-4 base tone frequencies merge.<br />
This  interdimensional Resonant Tone allows Earth’s 3-dimensional particle  ﬁeld
to raise in pulsation rhythm, to receive the progressive Transmutative Stellar
Wave Infusions and Stellar Activations that will allow Earth to rise into the
HU-2 time cycles for merger with Tara.  Without this interdimensional Reso-
nant Tone, created through the merger of Earth’s D-2 core frequencies
with the D-4 Solar Spiral frequencies, Earth would not be able to achieve
its temporary shift into the HU-2 time cycle. If Earth is unable to make
this shift, the grids of Earth and Tara will not fully merge and the Bridge
Zone project will fail. The Halls of Amenti will not open, the planetary
ascension process will halt and Earth and its populations will remain
trapped within the HU-1 time cycle to fall under Dracos-Zeta Resistance
control.<br />
The striking of this lnterdimensional Resonant Tone is a natural part of
Earth’s ascension cycle, and will take place on 1/1/2000, as Earth’s grid has
reached the necessary particle pulsation rhythm as of 6/26/1998. The
event of the interdimensional Resonant Tone Striking will occur on
schedule. The alignment between Earth’s D-2 core and the D-4 Solar
Spiral and the resulting Interdimensional Resonant Tone created through
this alignment, constitutes a Day of Transcendence , for Earth and its
populations. The boundaries of Earth’s 26,556-year HU-1 time cycle, and
humanity’s entrapment within HU-1 physical matter, will be temporarily
Transcended.  This Day of Transcendence marks the ﬁrst day of Earth’s new
dawn into the age of enlightenment and the opportunity to stop the Intruder Vis-
itors’ intended destruction of the human race .
The Interdimensional Resonant Tone of Transcendence Day is scheduled<br />
to occur between 12:00 PM of 1/1/2000 and 12:00  AM 1/2/2000,<br />
as Earth completes its first day of the new millennium.<br />

   Light Workers across the globe will be called together in celebration of
    this monumental occasion, and will be directed to begin Solar-Heart Star
     Activations for all who join them in this endeavor . The focused energies
     of the Light W orkers global network will serve to create balance and
  acceleration within Earth’ s grid, to prepare Earth for the initiation of its
   D-4 Solar Activation on 5/5/2000. This gathering of Light W orkers and
    others on 1/1/2000 is needed to counterbalance the fear-based, lower-
   vibrating energies of the fanatical groups who will promoting “millennial
  fever” and doom between 12/ 1999 and 1/2000. These fear-based energies
  have the potential to create temporary grid imbalances that could mani-
  fest as localized Earth changes, as Earth enters the Solar Activation on 5/
    5/2000. C elebration of the Day of Transcendence will serve as an Earth healing
                      measure, as well as a ceremony of human unity. Earth’ s fourth primary vortex-  
                       Giza, Egypt - will begin opening on this clay.                                  4.   1999-2004: First Birth Wave of Indigo Children.

Earth’s Grid. The Blue Flame Begins Its 12-year Descent to Earth,

Blue Flame Begin Fifth Strand-D-5 Pleiadian-Soul Seat Activation.
The 9540 BC Quarantine Frequency Fence Dissolves.<br />
As the Sphere of Amenti completes opening its D-3 frequencies into
Earth’ s morphogenetic field, it begins to transmit D-4 frequencies through
Earth’ s grid. The natural seal on Earth’ s fourth primary vortex/chakra
opens; Earth’ s fourth primary vortex is located beneath the Sphinx and
Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. The Keepers of the Blue and V iolet
Flames will complete their Solar Activation, assembly and activation of
DNA  strand four and Heart Star Activation. Through completion of the
Solar Activation, the first level of soul integration takes place, astral inte-
gration. The Keepers of the Blue Flame will begin their D-5 Pleiadian-
Soul Seat-Activation and will initiate assembly and activation of their
fifth DNA  strand, in preparation for grounding and embodying the fre-
quencies of the Blue Flame of Amenti on 5/5/2012. The Keepers of the
Blue Flame begin their Pleiadian-Soul Seat -Activation in 1/2000 and will
complete this second Activation and begin the Third Activation on 1/1/

             t o Earth through the Alcyone spiral and Solar Spirals. As D-4 frequencies
  from the Sphere of Amenti begin transmitting through Earth’ s core, the
    UHF band D-3 Quarantine Frequency Fence of 9540 BC completely
    releases, which creates a reversal of the third DNA  strand mutation that
    was caused by the Frequency Fence. This mutation manifested as a block-
   age in the third chakra and an arti ficial division within the third mental
     body level of the auric field, creating a division between the Ego/personal-
  ity awareness and the Higher Self awareness. Reversal of this mutation
       will allow humanity the opportunity to merge the Ego, stationed in the
  low to middle frequency bands of D-3, with the Higher Self identity , sta-
    tioned in the UHF bands of D-3. The Higher Self connects the D-3 con-
   scious identity to the astral and soul levels of identity. When the Ego and
     Higher Self merge, awareness of the astral and soul identity becomes more
  available to the Ego, dream reality and astral perception become clearer,
    fourth DNA  strand assembly and Solar Activation become available to
            the identity and consciousness begins to become multidimensional.                                                                                         Earth Solar Activation

Earth’ s D-1 electrical overtone particles in Earth’ s D-1 iron core crystal
begin to merge with Tara’s D-4 magnetic base tone anti-particles in Tara’s
D-4 gold core crystal, transmuting both into their higher-dimensional
morphogenetic fields/hyper-space (D-1 particles to D-15, D-4 anti-parti-
cles to D-12). This is considered a D-4 Solar Activation  as the Merkaba
Fields of the D-1 and D-4 core crystals are held within the center of the
sun and D-4 frequency transmits to Earth via the D-4 Solar Spiral. All of
Earth’ s D-1 overtone particles and T ara’ s D-4 base tone anti-particles
enter hyper-space and the overtone D-l and base tone D-4 Merkaba Fields
will open into each other. E arth’s D-1 overtone particle base will have
completed its shift into the pulsation rhythms of the D-4 time cycle and
Earth’s D-1 base tone particles enter D-3 pulsation rhythm. As Earth’s D-l
Merkaba Field opens into Tara’s D-4 Merkaba Field, the particle pulsation
speed of Earth’s core begins to rise into that of the D-4 frequency bands.
By the end of its Solar Activation in 6/2004 ,  Earth will complete 1/3 of its shift
into the HU-2 time cycles, in preparation for merger with Tara on 5/5/2012.

<p>and Earth’s D-2 and D-3 Merkaba Fields will merge with those of Tara,
placing Earth fully within the HU-2 time cycles by 1/2012. Earth’s Solar
Activation is the first of six Transmutative Stellar Activations the planet
will undergo between 2000 and 2017. Earth prepares for its Solar Activa-
tion in 1/2000, when its D-2 and D-3 particle bases align with the Solar
Spiral. The Solar Activation initiates on 5/5/2000, when Earth’s D-1 iron
core crystal aligns with the Solar Spiral. Earth’s Solar Activation begins in
5/5/2000 and will complete in 6/2004, at which time Earth’s second Stel-
lar Activation will begin. The corrected imprint for the fourth DNA
strand will release through the Earth’s grid on 5/5/2000. This will allow
people whom are consciously working to assemble DNA the opportunity
to release the Seal of Palaidor, Seal of Amenti and traces of the Zeta Seal
from their DNA, so fourth strand assembly and the Solar-Heart Star Acti-
vation can begin. Assembly and activation of the fourth DNA strand
allows the consciousness to achieve the first level of soul integration,
Astral integration.<br />
The D-4 Seal of Palaidor is a genetic mutation from 5,500,000 years
ago, which caused a blockage between the second and third chakras, a
division between the second, third and fourth levels of the auric field and
separation between emotional, mental and astral identity levels.  This seal is
released by fully assembling the fourth DNA strand.  Release of this seal allows
polarization in the fourth/heart chakra to reverse, and the D-2 emotional,
D-3 mental and D-4 astral levels of awareness to merge. The nadial cap-
sule (barrier between D-3 and D-4 frequency levels in the auric field) dis-
solves and the blockage between the D-3 conscious perceptions and D-2
sub-conscious mind releases. Release of the Seal of Palaidor represents the ﬁrst
stage of soul integration, as the conscious D-3 identity begins to access the D-4
astral planes and skills of D-4 projection of consciousness and multidimensional
communication develop.<br />
The Seal of Amenti , the Death Seal , is a genetic mutation from
5,508,100 years ago, a mutation in DNA strand 1, which caused a block-
age between the physical and etheric body. The sixth activation code
(overtone) of the first DNA strand was removed, which caused mutation
in the first, second and third DNA strands, that manifested as a block
between the body’s particles and the anti-particles of the body-double in
the parallel universe. This seal ended humanity’ s ability to possess an Immortal
Body and created the necessity for birth and death through incarnational cycles
in order to evolve. lt stopped the process of bodily transmutation and the ability
to physically pass through the Halls of Amenti, in the masses . Release of the
Seal of Amenti allows the body to merge its particles with those of its
anti-particle double and creates merging of the physical and etheric bod-
ies. This creates transmutation of the body form, the ability to bodily ascend, the
return of the Immortal Body and release from the cycles of reincarnation. Cre-

<p>Things to Come
ates the merger of consciousness between present identity and identity
focused in the parallel universe. Release of the Seal of Palaidor and assem-
bly of the full fourth and fifth DNA strands is necessary to reclaim the
Immortal Body . Release of the Seal of Amenti allows the process of fifth<br />
strand DNA assembly and Pleiadian-Soul Seat -Activation to continue.<br />
The Zeta Seal is a genetic mutation created in 1748 AD by the Zetas’
Frequency Fence in the D-4 time cycle. Zeta Seal was removed by Guard-
ians through astral realignment, between l902-1986, but traces of this
fourth DNA  strand mutation still appear in some humans. Zeta Seal
blocked D-4 frequency , and thus multidimensional perception, from the
D-3 perceptual awareness, creating an arti ficial barrier between the D-3
conscious self and the astral identity . The seal operated as an etheric
implant within the nadial capsule, between the third and fourth layers of
the auric field. This caused repression of dream recall and memory of mul-
tidimensional experience, and hampering of multidimensional communi-<br />
cation, astral projection and the soul integration processes. It allowed<br />
Zetas to electrically impulse human bio-chemical response patterns and
behavior, through subliminal manipulation of the bio-neurological struc-
ture. Zeta Seal releases with assembly of realigned fourth DNA strand .                                                                                      The Hall of Records
7.   September 17, 2001: Guardians Complete Alignment of Giza Pyramid
with Alcyone Spiral. Hall of Records Begins to Open.  The Guardians
will complete their Earth grid realignment, bringing the Great Pyramid of
Giza/vortex 4 into alignment with the Alcyone spiral in preparation for
the Holographic Beam of 2017. This will begin the opening of the Hall of
Records  beneath the Sphinx.<br />
The Hall of Records  is a fourth-dimensional portal passage storage area that
connects to the higher-dimensional morphogenetic ﬁelds of Earth, Tara and
Gaia, where the complete planetary memory banks are stored in the form of
crystalline energy substance . These crystalline morphogenetic imprints are
collectively called the Ancient Dora-Teura Matrix , and they contain the
entire living memory of the five Harmonic Universes in one l5-dimen-
ional system. The Akashic Record  planetary memory bank of D-8 is part
of the larger Ancient Dora-T eura Matrix memory complex. The Hall of
Records represents a D-4 conduit through which data from the Akashic
Record and Ancient Dora-T eura can be downloaded through the Earth’ s
seven-primary vortices and into the Sphere of Amenti and Earth’ s mor-
phogenetic field. The data is transferred electronically through the Hall of
Records, into Amenti and Earth’ s core, then into Earth’s grid. The history
of the universe then becomes available to anyone on Earth that has a high
enough accretion level to translate the data through their genetic cod e</p>

<p>and consciousness. The Hall of Records opens only when the Alcyone spi-
ral is aligned with the primary fourth vortex beneath the Sphinx and
Great Pyramid.<br />
Within the structure of the Sphinx there are several dormant portal pas-
sages that lead from the Sphinx, to the Great Pyramid then into the D-2
portal passage of Earth’s core, where the Sphere of Amenti is stored. Once
the Alcyone spiral is activated, these portals are accessible, but only to
individuals who carry very precise frequency tone combinations within
their bio-energetic fields. In order for the Hall of Records to release its
data through the portals of the Sphinx and into the Sphere of Amenti, the
three individuals who represent the Flame Holders of the D-2 Orange-
Gold Flame (a male), the D-5 Blue Flame (female) and the D-7 Violet
Flame (female) must enter the Sphinx through the D-4 astral plane, and
find their way to the inner chamber and the portal activation site, which
is a very small crawl space, boxed-in on three sides, just large enough to
hold three bodies (astral) lined up side by side. The activation site is
underground and is presently sealed by several layers of stone, its access
crawl space, through which it was constructed, is packed with earth. There
are several hidden passages within and beneath the Sphinx, that are marked with
a series of instructional symbol codes, the ﬁnal four of which can only be
decoded by the Flame Holders. The symbols are multidimensional Keylontic
Access Codes that, once translated and pulled into the body, serve as the elec-
tronic lock release for the Hall of Records.<br />
The Flame Holders will be guided to Egypt with a small support team to
help them hold the energy, at the appropriate time. The Flame Holders
must enter the activation site using the astral body. Ideally, they must
project from the physical body stationed within the King’s Chamber of the
Great Pyramid. When the Alcyone spiral is activated, the Flame Holders
within the Kings Chamber will receive a “Blue Flame Infusion” (a bodily
infusion of UHF D-5 energy from the Alcyone spiral), through an energy
rite known only to the Flame Holders and beings with D-15 “clearance”
(beings whom have undergone 15-dimensional initiations and carry the
imprint for D-13 through D-15 within their morphogenetic field). After
the infusions, the Flame Holders will link their bio-energetic fields, and
enter the astral plane and access site together. Once in the activation site
the three will blend the energies of their astral bodies in one unit of ultra-
conscious energy identity. The physical and astral bodies of the Flame
Holders serve as a conduit through which the electronically stored data
from the Hall of Records can download, activate the portals and pass into
the Sphere of Amenti. The Flame Holders allow the Hall of Records to be
put “on line” with the Sphere of Amenti, after which time this data trans-
mits through Earth’s grid and becomes available to anyone on Earth who
can translate the information. The Hall of Records begins opening with

  the activation of the Alcyone spiral, but cannot be accessed until the Blue
     Flame of Amenti embodies on Earth, with the birth of the sixth avatar .
   The birth of the sixth avatar creates an energetic connection between 12
      dimensions of the Hall of Records and the Earth’ s core, which allows data
   to ﬂow through the Flame Holders and into the Sphere of Amenti. If the
    Halls of Amenti cannot open, the Hall of Records also remains closed.
  Prior to the opening of the Hall of Records, the chambers leading to the
   dead-end in front of the activation site in the Sphinx will be discovered.
     The Halls of Amenti will begin to open on 5/5/2012. The Hall of Records
     will begin opening on 9/17/2001, but will not activate and begin transmit-
   ting data until after the birth of the sixth avatar, which is scheduled for
    12:01 am on 5/5/2012. At this time the Flame Holders will be called to
     activate the Hall of Records for the races.   
  8.  2001: Dracos-Zeta Resistance Tentative Plan to Stage Public Landing
   and Introduction to Begin Frequency Fence Project. Guardians Plan
          “Fly-by’s” if  Warning of Earth Changes Is Needed.   
         The Dracos-Zeta Resistance tentatively plans to stage a public landing in
   order to deceptively introduce themselves as Guardians and begin covert
               in filtration of Earth’s electrical power supply and water systems in prepara-
       tion for implementing their Frequency Fence . The Resistance forces will not
       land if they believe their Frequency Fence plan is in jeopardy.  If Earth’s grid
          reaches a 3.75-accretion level by 2001, (which will only occur if 8% of the
       population assembles the fifth DNA strand by 2001; this is not expected
       until just before 2012) the Resistance Frequency Fence will not work on
       the masses. If the Frequency Fence plan can be averted, the Resistance
        will abandon their direct take-over plans, and resort to instigating Earth
     changes.  
       If they cannot gain control over human populations, they still hope to
       stop the Halls of Amenti from opening, so the acceleration of the human
       genetic blueprint does not take place. The Resistance will lose control
       over their future D-4 stronghold if present human populations can assem-
       ble the fourth and fifth DNA strands. For this reason the Resistance has a
       vested interest in keeping the Halls of Amenti closed. Without the Fre-
       quency Fence it will be difficult for them to stop the Bridge Zone project,
       the opening of Amenti and the accelerated genetic evolution it will bring.
       If they cannot stop these events they will attempt to gain dominion over
       the D-3 “phantom Earth”, to begin rebuilding their strong hold from D-3
       after 2017, a plan that is likely to fail if Guardians decide to enforce a ban 
      on Resistance presence.  
         If   the  Frequency  Fence   plan  is  stopped  there    is  a  strong   likelihood  that Resistance
      forces will leave of their own accord.  If the Frequency Fence plan is not
 stopped, humans remaining on D-3 phantom Earth will still remain vul-

<p>nerable to Resistance in filtration. The Frequency Fence plan can still be
averted if the Interior Government stops all cooperation with the Resis-
tance EBEs and refuses to allow the 2003 experiment to take place.
In the event that the public landing of 2001 does occur, the Resistance
Frequency Fence plan is still operational, and Earth populations will have
until 2004 to assemble DNA  to the 3.75 accretion level in order to protect
themselves from the Frequency Fence. If the Frequency Fence plan is
operational Guardian V isitors may stage mass sighting “ ﬂy-by’s”, anytime
between 1998-2004, in order to warn the populations that Earth changes
will be coming due to the Frequency Fence. In the event that the Fre-
quency Fence is averted by 2004, and severe Earth changes are not
expected, Guardians will NOT stage mass “fly-by’ s”. W e are hoping the
Frequency Fence plan will be abandoned. Humanity can help this effort
by trying to assemble and activate the fifth DNA strand in 8% of the pop-
ulations by 2001. Presently an estimated 0.24% of global populations have
the fifth strand assembled and activated. Reaching 8% by 2001 is not
likely , but it is not impossible if humanity really tries to reach this goal. If
this goal can be reached the Dracos-Zeta Resistance takeover plan can be
stopped before it is put into action.<br />
9.  January 2002: Keepers of the Blue and Violet Flames End Blue Wave
Infusions. Keepers of the Blue Flame Begin Violet W ave Infusions.

6/D-7 W ave Infusions, D-6 base tone and D-7 overtone frequencies, and
imprints for DNA  strands 6 and 7, enter into the morphogenetic fields of
the Keepers of the Blue Flame. The Keepers of the Violet Flame will begin
their D-5 Pleiadian-Soul Seat Activation on 1/1/2005 and their V iolet
W ave Infusions will begin in 1/2007. Shifting to the Bridge Zone Earth
requires completion of the Blue W ave Infusion, activation of half of the
fifth DNA strand, completion of the Solar-Heart Star Activation and half
of the Pleiadian-Soul Seat Activation. The D-5 Pleiadian Activation
becomes available to the masses (those who were not born with the fifth
DNA  strand imprint) on 9/9/2004, with the birth of A vatar 4 and the
release of the corrected fifth DNA strand imprint through Earth’s grid. At
this time fifth strand assembly can begin for those who completed fourth
strand assembly and Heart Star Activation through the Solar Activation.
The masses will not be able to complete the D-5 Pleiadian Activation
until the 5/5/2012, following the birth of A vatar 6 and the activation of
the fifth-strand codes.<br />

<p>Infusion.<br />
Earth is halfway through its D-4 Solar Activation, as the frequencies of
the D-5/D-6 Blue W ave Infusion descend through the Pleiadian-Alcyone
and Solar Spirals, beginning Earth’ s first Transmutative Stellar Wave lnfu-
sion, the D-5/D-6 Blue W ave Infusion. Through these D-5/D-6 W ave
Infusions, D-5 base tone and D-6 overtone frequencies enter into Earth’ s
core morphogenetic field. Earth’s Blue Wave Infusion will complete in 6/
2006, when Earth’ s V iolet W ave Infusion begins. In 6/2004 the D-5 Pleia-
dian-Alcyone Spiral comes into alignment with the D-4 Solar Spiral,
completing Earth’s D —4 Solar Activation and beginning Earth’s D-5 Pleia-
dian Activation. Earth will complete six Stellar W ave Infusions between
6/2002 and 6/2017. Three of these infusions will occur concurrently with
the final three Stellar Activations within a 3-day period that will fall
somewhere between 5/5/2017 and 6/30/2017.                                                                                                                                                                           2003 Zeta Experiment
11. August 12, 2003: Dracos-Zeta Resistance and Covert Government
Dimensional Blending Experiment.<br />
The Dracos-Zeta Resistance hopes to coerce the Interior Government to
orchestrate a Dimensional Blending Experiment through top secret mili-
tary operations. The experiment resembles the Philadelphia Experiment
of 1943 and the Montauk Project of 1983. The Resistance’ s covert moti-
vation for the 2003 experiment is to create a rip in space-time that will
connect with space-time rips that were made during the experiments in
1943 and 1983, so they may cloak large numbers of spacecraft while bring-
ing them into underground bases. The presence of these underground
fleets at three different time intervals, is necessary for the Resistance to
broadcast the EM pulses of their intended Frequency Fence. If the Interior
Government and world military organizations can be convinced to stop any
such dimensional blending experiments, especially during the months of July
through October of 2003, the Frequency Fence agenda will be abandoned.
12. Spring 2004: Dracos-Zeta Resistance to Begin EM Pulses of Frequency
Fence.<br />
If the Dracos-Zeta Resistance is successful in motivating the 2003 experi-
ment and the Earth’s grid is not yet at 3.75 accretion, they intend to begin
broadcasting the base EM pulses of the Frequency Fence, from several
underground base locations. The Resistance will have introduced an
undetectable organic element to mass water supplies by this time, which is
needed to repress the human body’ s natural immunological response to
the foreign EM pulses used in the Frequency Fence. If transmission of the
Frequency Fence base pulses begins, an undetectable ULF “phantom”
electrical pulse will begin to be transmitted through Earth’ s grid, into the

<p>bio-energetic and electro-chemical systems of humans and into mass elec-
trical power stations. The phantom pulse will follow the natural ﬂow of
electricity from main power generation plants into all electrical systems
drawing power from those plants, and will thus be transmitted through all
commercial and residential electrical devices. The ULF EM phantom
pulse will create a subtle disruption within the bio-energetic fields of
humans, which will manifest in the body as a bio-neurological perceptual
block,  through which the human conscious and sub-consciousness minds
can be blocked from translating perceptual data from all but a few select
dimensional frequency bands.  A “perceptual harness” on human conscious-
ness will result, through which the Resistance can transmit Holographic Inserts
and subliminally impulse human behavioral response patterns directly through
the sub-conscious mind and physical body .<br />
The human body has a natural immune response to such electromag-
netic invasion, which the Resistance can repress by introducing a certain
organic elemental compound into the water supply, and by transmitting
speci fic wave spectrums of light directly into the human optical facilities.
Technologies such as broadcast television are intended as vehicles to carry
the subliminal light-spectrum patterns into the human optical facilities.
Common radio waves are also intended as carriers of subsequent EM
pulses, which will serve to reinforce the bio-neurological programming of
the Frequency Fence.<br />
The Resistance will attempt to use your own technologies against you.
After approximately six years of such covert electromagnetic manipula-
tion, the contrived electromagnetic imprint will be strong enough to over-
ride the natural DNA imprint within the personal morphogenetic field.
The perceptual harness will manifest as a genetic mutation within the
human DNA, a mutation that will be genetically passed on through
breeding. The Frequency Fence is a powerful, advanced, EM pulse tech-
nology of which the Resistance is in possession and now intends to use on
the human populations. Human technology presently does not have such
command of EM pulse mechanics, and so will be unable to create techno-
logical protection from the Frequency Fence.<br />
However, humanity does possess the natural ability to accelerate the genetic
code, through which natural immunity to the Frequency Fence, the water
additive and the subliminal, digital light-spectrum transmissions can be
created.  It is much easier to prevent the Frequency Fence from affecting the bio-
neurological system, by building this natural immunity before the EM pulse
transmissions begin, than it will be to reverse the effects of these transmissions
once the broadcasting is initiated . If the Frequency Fence plan is not averted
by 2004, the Frequency Fence will be operational by 2006, at which time
the Resistance will begin broadcasting mass Holographic Inserts —five-<br />

    open and activate as the D-5 Alcyone spiral aligns with the D-4 Solar Spi-
     ral. Earth’ s fifth primary vortex is located in Machu Picchu, Peru. The
    Sphere of Amenti begins transmitting its D-5 frequencies into Earth’ s grid
    as Earth completes its D-4 Solar Activation and begins its D-5 Pleiadian
     Activation. The morphogenetic wave continues build. The particles of

    D-5 and D-6 Merkaba Field, through the pathway of the Alcyone spiral.
    By the end of its Pleiadian Activation in 6/2008, Earth will complete the
    final 2/3 of its shift into the HU-2 time cycles, in preparation for merger

    but must take place by September 9, 2004, to realign the fifth DNA strand
    imprint in the Sphere of Amenti morphogenetic field, before this strand
    imprint begins transmitting through Earth’ s grid on 9/9/2004. The fourth
    avatar is a D-10 soul essence from HU-4, a tenth-level avatar, with 10-

transmitting through Earth’s grid. The Palaidor, Amenti and Zeta Seals
will be fully released from the DNA in all whom worked to assemble the
fourth strand. Though the corrected fifth strand begins assembly in 2004,
for most of the populations it will not fully activate, or plug into the lower
strands and become operational, until 5/5/2012, when the Blue Flame is
embodied on Earth. The D-5 Pleiadian Activation pre-activation strand 5
assembly becomes available to the masses on 9/9/2004, but completion of
this activation and activation of the Soul Seat Star Crystal, will not be
available to the masses until the fifth strand activates after 5/5/2012.
Completion of the Pleiadian Activation and assembly and activation of
the fifth DNA strand allows the consciousness to achieve the second level
of soul integration, the Soul Seat Activation, and begins the process of
cellular transmutation through which the body can raise its particle pulsa-
tion rhythm into the HU-2/D-5 time cycle for teleportation through the
Halls of  Amenti.  Ascension to Tara requires completion of the Pleiadian Acti-
vation, full activation of strand 5, completion of  half of the Violet Wave Infusion
and activation of the Soul Seat Star Crystal.<br />

ration for embodying Tara’s Blue Flame morphogenetic field on 5/5/2012.
The Keepers of the V iolet Flame begin their D-5 Pleiadian-Soul Seat

     and begin its D-7/D-8 Gold Wave Infusion in 6/2010.  
     18. 2006: Dracos-Zeta Resistance to Begin Broadcasting Holographic
    Inserts, if Frequency Fence is Established in 2004.  
 Dracos-Zeta Resistance plans to begin broadcasting mass Holographic
  Inserts through their Frequency Fence in order to direct populations away
    from the path of ascension and to establish full covert control over global
  social and economic structures. Once populations are under perceptual
   control Resistance members can walk among humans undetected. They
  plan to create various types of geographical disturbances that interfere
   with the grid merger between Earth and Tara. If it was not for the Bridge
   Zone Project these activities could have stopped the opening of the Halls
  of Amenti. The Frequency Fence and intended grid disruptions can still
   cause Earth changes between 2012-2017, but the Halls of Amenti will
    remain stable as long as Earth&#39;s core morphogenetic field reaches the 3.5
   accretion level necessary for Earth to enter the Bridge Zone pulsation
   rhythm in 2012. Only the phantom Earth that returns to the D-3 time
     cycle after 2017 will be susceptible to Resistance control and the massive
   Earth changes that could result from the Frequency Fence and related
    activity. Humans with an accretion level below 4.5 (all of the fourth DNA
    strand assembled and activated plus half of the fifth strand) will end up in
  this future D-3 time continuum after 2017. The Earth changes, Holo-
     graphic Inserts and mental take over can be stopped in this D-3 time cycle
  if humanity can help the Guardians stop the Resistance from activating
    the Frequency Fence in 2004.

The Keepers of the Blue Flame begin activating the eighth DNA strand,
initiating their D-8 Orion-Earth Core Activation, which allows integra-

causes the Core Star crystal energy center within the body (above the
navel, below the third Solar Plexus chakra) to transmit D-7 frequency.
The bodies of the Flame Keepers become transmitters of UHF light and
sound, as their bio-energetic fields fill with D-7 frequency. The Flame
Keepers become conduits for D-7 energies, which ﬂow to Earth from the
Arcturian Spiral, through the Sirian, Pleiadian-Alcyone and Solar Spirals.
Through the bodies of the Flame Keepers achieving Arcturian-Core Star

The Keepers of the Blue Flame are half way through their D-8 Orion-
Earth Core  Activation, the D-8/D-9 Silver Wave Infusion that began in 6/<br />
2011 completes and the D-9/D-10 Blue-Black Liquid Light Wave Infusion<br />
begins. Through these D-8/D-9 W ave Infusions, the D-9 base tone and D-
8 overtone frequencies, and imprints for DNA strands 9 and 10, enter into<br />
the morphogenetic fields of the Keepers of the Blue Flame.<br />
27. May 5, 2012, 12:01 AM: Birth of Avatar 6—12th-level Avatar. Will<br />
Align DNA Strand 7 Imprint with 12-strand Pattern. Templar-Axion<br />
Seal Releases from Human DNA as Corrected Strand 7 Imprint Begins<br />
Transmitting through Earth’s Grid.<br />
The sixth of six Silent Avatars will be born precisely at this time, passing<br />
through the Sphere of Amenti into fetal integration at 12:01 am, on 5/5/<br />
2012. This is a D-l2 soul essence from HU-4, a 12th-level avatar, which is<br />
the highest level of identity that can be embodied through the human
genetic code. Jesheua-12 (12 BC-27 AD), of   the  soul  identity   Sananda, was
the last level 12 avatar to incarnate on Earth . The sixth avatar will be born<br />
with 12-dimensional frequency bands activated in his genetic code, a fully<br />
activated DNA  strand 12. As his soul essence passes through the Sphere
of Amenti, the imprint for DNA strand 7 will realign with the 12-strand
pattern, and the seventh strand imprint will begin transmitting through<br />
Earth’s grid. As the seventh DNA strand imprint aligns and activates,<br />
the  D-7 “666”  Templar-Axion Seal , which imposed repeated reincarnation
for humans who carried this DNA mutation, is released from Templar-
Axion sealed humans who begin assembling the seventh DNA strand .                                                Halls of Amenti Open<br />
28.  May 5, 2012: The Grids of Earth and Tara Begin to Merge and  the<br />
Morphogenetic Wave Prepares to Crest. The Keepers of the Blue Flame<br />
End D-8 Orion-Earth Core Activation and Begin D-9 Andromeda-<br />
Galactic Core  Activation. The Blue Flame of Amenti Embodies within
the Keepers  of  the Blue Flame. Spontaneous Mass Awakening Occurs.
The Halls of Amenti Open and Ascensions Begin. The Three Flame
Holders Are Called to Giza to Activate the Hall of Records.
The grids of Earth and Tara begin to merge as the morphogentic wave
prepares to crest. The Keepers of the Blue Flame complete their D-8
Orion-Earth Core Activation, becoming eighth-level avatars and begin
their D-9 Andromeda-Galactic Core Activation. As the ninth DNA

<p>embodies and the Keepers of the Blue Flame become ninth-level avatars.
The Keepers of the Blue Flame will complete their D-9 Andromeda Acti-
vation, to become ninth-level avatars, on day one of the Three-day Parti-
cle Conversion Period between 5/5/2017 and 6/30/2017. On 5/5/2012 the
Blue Flame of Amenti descends through the Alcyone spiral and into
embodiment within the Keepers of the Blue Flame. Embodiment of the
Blue Flame takes place through the primary Flame Holder, who magneti-
cally draws the Blue Flame from the Alcyone spiral and into her bio-ener-
getic field and body. Flame Holders carry a speci fic magnetic base tone
within their DNA that allows the bio-energetic system to become highly
magnetic, when this recessive gene is activated. Without this extremely
rare recessive gene, the human body would be ripped apart in attempting
to draw energy directly from the Alcyone spiral while the Blue or Violet
Flames are descending. Flame Holders are incarnated on Earth during
appropriate times, after carefully selecting a parental lineage (via
Palaidorian Birthing Contracts) that carries this recessive gene, speci fi-
cally to fill this role. These individuals are predestined via over-soul con-
tracts, to ful fill this role.<br />
There are three Flame Holder positions to fill, that of the D-2 Orange-
gold Flame (requiring male embodiment) and those of the D-5 Blue and
D-7 Violet Flames (female embodiments). For each position there are only
three individuals born that can fill this role, for a total of nine individuals
on the planet at any one time, who will carry this rare recessive gene. The
primary position is held by a Flame Holder who is appointed by the Galac-
tic Council of HU-4 and the second and third positions serve as “back-
up”, in the event that the primary Flame Holder cannot ful fill the role.
The primary Flame Holder chooses the souls who will serve as back up and
they incarnate during the same time period as per these soul agreements.
The Keepers of the Flames are likewise born into their roles via soul agree-
ments and will begin to awaken to their greater mission once it is time for
their service to begin. The Flame Keepers and Holders have begun to
awaken to their identity over the last 15 years. Once the Blue Flame
Holder has drawn the Blue Flame from the Alcyone spiral, the Flame
Holder then down-grades the frequencies of the Blue Flame through her
bio-energetic field and transfers the frequencies of the Blue Flame into the
Flame Keepers via the fourth/Heart chakra. Once the Blue Flame frequen-
cies stabilize in the morphogenetic fields of the Flame Keepers, an intense
infusion of HU-2 frequencies spreads through the Amenti morphogenetic
field and through the Earth’s grid, which allows rapid acceleration of fifth
and sixth DNA strand assembly to occur throughout the populations who
have begun assembling the fifth and sixth strands. The seventh strand will
begin to assemble in those who have assembled strands 6 and below.
Strand 5 rapidly begins to activate triggering a spontaneous expansion of
219</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>                 Things to Come
multidimensional awareness and awakening to multidimensional memory
 and identity within the populations who assembled the fifth strand.
 Strands 6 and 7, which have been assembled, will remain dormant until
activation during the Three-day particle conversion period between 5/5/
  2017 and 6/30/2017.     
 As the grids of Earth and Tara begin to merge, the Halls of Amenti, within
 the Sphere of Amenti at Earth’ s core, begin to open and people who have
 assembled the fifth strand and above can begin passing through the portals
   that connect to the Halls of Amenti and T ara. At this time, forward
    through 2022, people on the ascension path to T ara will be guided to the
  appropriate portal or interdimensional Transport locations for transfer to
 T ara. Just following the birth of A vatar six on 5/5/2012, the three primary
 Flame Holders and their support team will be called to Egypt to activate
  the Hall of Records portals. Numerous groups will try this feat prior to this
 time, but only the three Flame Holders possess the needed frequency
 codes in their bio-energetic fields to allow them to serve as conduits for
  downloading the electronic transmissions from the Dora-T eura Matrix
  and Akashic Record. Once the portals between the Sphinx, Great Pyra-
      mid and Earth&#39;s core open, universal memory comes “on line” within the
      Sphere of Amenti and the Sphere of Amenti prepares to release this con-
      tinual ﬂow of electronically coded data into Earth’s grid, where it can be
      picked up through the human bio-energetic field and translated into con-
        scious information. Reincarnational and race memory will become avail-
   able to people who have assembled the fourth DNA strand and above.

  anti-particles of T ara, within the pulsation rhythm of the D-4 time cycle.
   Earth’ s particle base temporarily raises to an accretion level of 4, its ele-
    mental particle base raises to 5-accretion and its atmospheric particle base
    raises to a 6-accretion level. Earth will remain in the D-4 time cycle until
    the morphogenetic wave crest ends at the half cycle point in 2017 and the
   particle fields make their final transition into their respective time cycles.
    The   reversal and shifting of the magnetic and electrical poles of Earth and Tara
       does not create a physical pole reversal or shift, because the action of reversal
  and shift of  Earth  and  Tara are simultaneous and counter-balance each other, as
     long as both grids are properly aligned . In areas where the grids are not bal-
 anced and aligned, tectonic cracking and shifting, and volcanic activity of
 varying degrees may result. The reversal of particle activity will be prima-
 rily undetectable to earthly equipment and human perception, as such
devices are also composed of particles, which will shift along with Earth’s
dimensional perception. There will be some subtle observable variance in
     Earth’s magnetic fields, and an increase in gamma wave activity.  
  The Hall of Records  will begin transmitting data through the Sphere of
 Amenti and Earth’ s grid, releasing universal memory into the planetary
memory banks of Earth’ s morphogenetic field, making personal and race
incarnational memory available to humans with fourth DNA  stand assem-

<p>from the Holographic Beam and the morphogenetic wave completes its
crest. Earth’s base tone magnetic fields temporarily collapse and Earth’s
particles and Tara’s anti-particles slow in pulsation, in preparation for the
return to their original polarity and angular rotation of spin. The Earth’s
electrical overtone particles, which were in hyper-space, re-manifest as
magnetic base tone anti-particles in Tara’s grid. Tara’s magnetic base tone
anti-particles return from hyper-space and re-manifest as electrical over-
tone particles in Gaia’s grid. As this occurs, the base tone particles of
Earth and the overtone anti-particles of Tara reverse their polarity, return-
ing to their original orientation. Usually, at this point in the particle con-
version process,  the particles and anti-particles would normally reverse
the 45° shift in angular rotation of spin that began on 12/21/2012. The
particles of Earth and anti-particles of Tara would begin re-orientation
into the pulsation rhythms of their original time cycles.<br />
At this phase of the particle conversion process the Bridge Zone comes
into play. The base tone particles of Earth, that would normally slow in
pulsation rhythm and return to the D-3 time cycle, will instead be divided
into two groups. Through beaming a continual stream of D-3.5 energy
through Earth’s core and grid via the Holographic Beam throughout the
three day period, the Guardians will be able to keep the accretion level of
most of Earth’s particle base and its morphogenetic field at 3.5. After the
3-day period ends, Earth’s base tone magnetic fields return and they would
normally seal Earth’s particle pulsation rhythm into the D-3 time cycle. By
shifting the angular rotation of particle spin 22.5° in reverse, instead of
the natural 45 ° rotation, while keeping Earth at a 3.5 accretion level when
the magnetic fields return, most of Earth’s particle base will be shifted into
the Bridge Zone and magnetically sealed at the 3.5 accretion level. The
Bridge Zone represents the natural time cycle of Inner Earth-Agartha. The por-
tions of Earth’ s particle base that cannot hold the infusion of D-3.5 frequency
will drop rapidly into D-3 pulsation rhythm while the magnetic ﬁelds are down,
creating a phantom Earth particle body in the D-3 time cycle.  The primary par-
ticle base and morphogenetic field of Earth, which are holding the 3.5 fre-
quency, will shift into the pulsation rhythm of the Bridge Zone time
continuum, instead of returning to the pulsation rhythm of the D-3 time
cycle. The Bridge  Zone time continuum represents a 2213-year  leap  forward in
space-time.<br />
Time-Leap Mechanics<br />
The Bridge Zone Earth jumps from its natural 2.5 accretion level to the
3.5 accretion level, which constitutes a 22l3-year leap forward in the
tracks of time. Normally Earth would reach the three accretion level dur-
ing the second morphogenetic wave 2213 years in the future in 4230 AD,
at which point it would naturally transition into the first D-4 time cycle.
225</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   Things to Come       
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Earth would then spend another half cycle in D-4 until it reached a 3.5
accretion level during the first morphogenetic wave of the first D-4 ascen-
sion cycle. The Bridge Zone continuum omits 2213 years of the last half of the
D-3 cycle and the ﬁrst half of the D-4 cycle, which represents 1106.5 years.
The D-4 cycle moves (has a particle pulsation rhythm) twice as fast as the
D-3 continuum, which means that passage through the D-4 time contin-
uum takes half as many years as it takes to pass through the D-3 contin-
uum. In D-3, half of a continuum cycle represents 2213 years, so half of a
D-4 cycle represents half of 2213 years, or 1106.5 years. Earth leaps ahead
2213 years by skipping the second half of its D-3 continuum cycle, and
ahead another 1106.5 years by skipping the first half of its D-4 cycle. This
creates a cumulative 3319.5-year leap ahead in space-time. This 3319.5-
year leap does not include the time reversal acquired within the Bridge
Zone. A  22.5° reverse rotation of particle spin is used to shift Earth into
the Bridge Zone continuum.<br />
One full D-3 cycle of 4426 years represents a cumulative 45° shift in angu-
lar rotation of particle spin, thus a 22.5° shift in angular rotation of parti-
cle spin in D-3 represents half D-3 cycle —2213 years. In D-4, where the
particle pulsation rhythm is twice as fast as that of D-3, 2213 years repre-
sents one full D-4 time cycle —a 45° shift in angular rotation of particle
spin = 2213 years in D-4. A 22.5° shift of angular rotation of particle spin
in D-4 represents 1106.5 years. The D-4 22.5° reverse shift in angular rota-
tion of particle spin, which is used to create the Bridge Zone shift, trans-
lates into a minus 1106.5 years. In raising the accretion level of Earth from
2.5 to 3.5, Earth omits 2213 years from its D-3 time track and 1106.5 years
from its D-4 time track, for a total forward leap of 3319.5 years. However,
the angular rotation of Earth’s particle spin will be shifted 22.5° in reverse
within the D-4 cycle, in order to enter the Bridge Zone, creating a minus<br />
1106.5 years. In entering the Bridge Zone continuum, Earth moves ahead<br />
3319.5 years, then back 1106.5 years, in terms of time-space placement, for a
total forward time gain of 2213 years, or half of a D-3 cycle (3319.5-
1106.5=2213 years).  ²
Following  the three-day particle conversion  period, which will occur sometime
between 5/5/2017 and 6/30/2017, as the Bridge Zone Earth takes its position
2213 years in the future at accretion level 3.5, the phantom Earth becomes a
Descending Planet and re-enters the D-3 time continuum, returning to its origi-
nal 2.5-accretion level.  People who have assembled a minimum of all of the

<p>Zone Earth. People with less DNA  strand assembly , and an accretion level
of less than 4.5 will shift back to the D-3 time continuum when Earth
leaves the D-4 continuum following the three-day period. In previous sec-
tions, we have discussed the experiential perceptions one will encounter
within each of the three tracks of time, and what one might expect to
experience through this transition period, so we will not restate that infor-
mation here. During this 3-day period, when the Meta-galactic portals open,
people who have fully assembled and activated the sixth DNA strand can  ascend
directly out of matter into etheric matter on Gaia, and those who have activated
the eighth strand can ascend directly through the Meta-galactic Core into pure
morphogenetic consciousness in   dimensions  9-12. During the  three-day period of
full alignment with the Holographic Beam, a burst of accelerating energy runs
through Earth’ s grid, allowing many others to almost instantaneously assemble
the ﬁfth or sixth strands, giving them a ﬁnal opportunity to ascend to Tara or
Gaia. Orion, Arcturian and Andromeda Stellar Activations take place in this 3-
day period.<br />
38. July 2017: Planetary Cores of Earth, Tara, Gaia, Meta-galactic Core
and Galactic Core Pass out of Alignment, Earth Passes out of Align-
ment with the Holographic Beam and the Ascension Portals to Gaia
and Meta-galactic Core Close. The Merkaba Fields of Earth, Phantom
Earth and Tara Separate and the Collapsed Planetary Magnetic Fields
Regenerate, Sealing The Planets Into Their Respective Time Contin-
uum Cycles. The Grids Of Earth And Tara Begin To Separate As Pop-
ulations Adjust to their New Reality Fields. The Halls of Amenti
Remain Open to Bridge Zone Populations and Ascensions to Tara Con-
tinue. The Transmitting Rhythm of the Hall of Records Slows, and the
Seven Primary Vortices on Earth and Phantom Earth Begin their Clos-
ing Cycle.<br />
After a 3-day period within the Holographic Beam, Earth moves out of
alignment with the Holographic Beam and the planetary cores of Earth,
T ara, Gaia, the Meta-galactic Core and Galactic Core pass out of align-
ment with each other. This causes the portal passages to Gaia and the Meta-
galactic Core  to  close, ending  the  ascension  cycle  to the   reality   ﬁelds of   Gaia  and
beyond.  The Merkaba Fields of Earth, Phantom Earth, T ara and Gaia,
which merged through Earth’s six Stellar Activations, separate and the
planetary magnetic fields, that had collapsed during the 3-day period,
regenerate, sealing Earth, Phantom Earth, T ara and Gaia into their respec-
tive dimensional time continuum cycles. The grids of Earth, Phantom
Earth and T ara begin to separate, as the particle pulsation rhythms of each
planet adjust to their respective time cycle rhythms and human popula-
tions adjust to their new reality fields on T ara, Bridge Zone Earth and

Phantom Earth. Ascensions to Tara, through the Halls of Amenti, con-
 tinue for populations stationed within the Bridge Zone and the Halls of
Amenti close to populations stationed on Phantom Earth in the D-3 time
   continuum cycle. The rate of data transmission through the Hall of
 Records slows on Bridge Zone Earth and the Hall of Records closes to
  Phantom Earth. As Earth passes out of alignment with the Holographic
  Beam, the Seven primary vortices on Earth and Phantom Earth enter
    their closing and deactivation cycle.

<li><p>January 1, 2022: Earth’s Seventh Vortex—Andes Mountains-—Closes.
Infusions of D-5-D-7 Frequency through Earth’s Grid Cease and
Accelerated Assembly of DNA  Strands 5 and 6 Ends. The Mass
Ascension Cycle Comes to a Close as the Halls of Amenti Close to the
Masses. The Grids of Earth and Tara Completely Separate.<br />
The natural seal within Earth’s seventh vortex re-seals, closing and deacti-
vating the seventh vortex in the Andes Mountains. Following this re-seal-
ing, the Earth’s grid begins to slow in particle pulsation speed to the Bridge
Zone-Agartha time continuum rhythm and the infusions of D-5-D-7
energy , that had been running through Earth’s grid, cease. In the absence
of these UHF energy infusions, the acceleration of assembling and activat-
ing DNA  strands 5-7 ends. Humans who do not organically carry the
imprint for the fifth and sixth DNA strands will find that the portions of
these strands that had begun assembly and activation during the infusion
acceleration, but which had not yet fully assembled, will begin rapid deac-
tivation and disassembly, once the Earth grid infusions have ceased. Popu-
lations in the Bridge Zone, who have not assembled and activated the fifth
DNA  strand, will return to a 4.5-strand assembly level (4.5 accretion),
and populations on Phantom Earth will return to 3.5-strand DNA  assem-
bly (3.5 accretion).  The DNA will return to its natural accretion level and
evolution of DNA will return to its slow and methodical process. On Bridge
Zone Earth, the Halls of Amenti will close to the masses that did not com-
plete fifth DNA strand assembly. Passage through the Halls of Amenti
requires a fifth DNA strand activation level. As long as the Sphere of
Amenti remains unsealed within Bridge Zone Earth’ s Morphogenetic
Field, the Halls of Amenti will remain open to anyone in the Bridge Zone
who can assemble the fifth strand, but fifth strand assembly may now take
several incarnations. The Hall of Records remains open in the Bridge
Zone, as long as Earth’ s grid stays aligned with the Alcyone spiral, but it
will transmit data at a much slower rate.<br />
The grids of Earth and T ara complete their separation and the ascension
cycle comes to a close, as humanity faces its new reality within three dif-
ferent tracks of time. One part of humanity will experience the future in
the D-3 Phantom Earth time cycle, another part will move into the age of
enlightenment within the Bridge Zone-Inner Earth time cycle, 2213 years

<p>in the future and a relative few will voyage into the lands of Tara, within<br />
the D-5 time cycles, a position in space-time 5532.5 years in the future of<br />
present day Earth. The D-3 phantom Earth will take its own course of<br />
development as Earth, with the Sphere of Amenti in its core morphoge-<br />
netic field, moves forward in the Bridge Zone continuum. For populations<br />
remaining in the D-3 time cycle, both the Halls of Amenti and the Hall of<br />
Records closes completely and permanently. Ascension from the D-3<br />
cycle will require Guardian assistance because the Sphere of Amenti and<br />
Earth’s morphogenetic field are no longer at the core of the Phantom<br />
Earth planet, they are within the planetary core of Bridge Zone Earth.<br />
Future ascension from the D-3 cycle will require a Host Matrix/Soul<br />
Matrix transplant, as those remaining in D-3 will be cut off from the plan-<br />
etary and race morphogenetic fields, and thus also cut off from their per-<br />
sonal Soul Matrix in HU-2. People of the Phantom Earth will experience<br />
a genetic mutation through which the third and fourth DNA strands are<br />
unable to plug into each other. This will create a permanent separation<br />
between the D-4 astral identity and the D-3 ego identity and a separation<br />
of the lower three levels of the auric field from the fourth and higher levels<br />
of the Soul Matrix. This condition can be remedied only through a Host<br />
Matrix Transplant, such as that employed by the Palaidorians, when they<br />
created the Sphere of Amenti “rescue mission” for the lost souls of Tara.<br />
This is one of the problems consciousness faces when evolving on a<br />
“Phantom” Descending Planet. Can you understand why the Guardian<br />
races are attempting to inform you of and motivate you to consciously par-<br />
ticipate in, the accelerated evolution of your DNA? Ascend while ascension<br />
is relatively easy, during the 2012-2022 ascension cycle,  for if you do not,<br />
ascension and soul evolution will be much more dif ﬁcult thereafter, for you and<br />
your future incarnations.<br />

Beginning with the closing of Earth’s seventh vortex in 1/2022, vortices 6<br />
through 1 begin their respective closing cycles, ending with the sealing of<br />
the first vortex in 6/2047. We will provide a list of vortex opening and<br />

FINAL 1998  COMMENTS FROM THE GUARDIAN ALLIANCE</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Throughout the course of this book we have led you on an odyssey into
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>worlds of perception far beyond the focus of your three-dimensional view . We
have recounted pieces of your past as a race, in order to show you the lengthy
path it has taken for you to arrive at your present state of evolution. Perhaps
in reviewing just how far your race has come and what great difficulties you
have encountered, you will be able to appreciate the opportunity that is now
presented to you within the ful fillment of your present ascension cycle. Most
humans on Earth have received little, if any, valid training regarding the
rights and responsibilities of personal and collective evolution. You have
been conditioned for eons to become lost within the perceptual maze of the
three-dimensional illusion, to the extent that most of you have completely
lost touch with the greater reality from which your earthly life springs. You
have been sleeping children, lost within a dreamland of material perception,
and few among you have made a valiant effort to lift your heads above the
clouded seductions of your dreamscape. This will change. lt must, for if you
remain asleep, your dream shall become a nightmare, within which you shall
find yourselves imprisoned. The destiny of your race and your planet is now
in your hands. Though the teachings we bring to you may seem strange, and
indeed alien, you have the capacity to employ this knowledge to your own
bene fit, if you will permit your ego to get out of the way of your intuitive per-
ceptions. The truths of which we speak echo through the cells of your body
and whisper through the winds of your mind, waiting for you to embrace
them as you reclaim your forgotten souls.<br />
In future Keylontic transmissions we will bring to you the technical
data of energy mechanics you will need to begin taking responsibility for the
evolution of your DNA and consciousness. As you can see, when viewing the
ascension schedule we have provided, there is little time left for you to debate
the validity of our information. Those of you who will venture to explore our
perspective will have an easier time comprehending the changes you will per-
ceive in the reality around you and you will have the opportunity to develop
survival skills that will allow you to face these changes with dignity and
grace. The Guardian races have been with you long before your arrival on
Earth 550,000,000 years ago. They are no strangers to the human lineage. It
is you who have forgotten. The quality of your future experience will depend
upon your remembering and your awakening to the multidimensional iden-
tity that is your heritage and birthright.<br />

The most important thing you can do after reading this material, is to
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>make a firm personal commitment to reclaiming your private spiritual
nature and to learning the energetic skills that will allow you to
do this as rapidly as possible.<br />
If you are wise, you will begin preparing yourselves for the energy infu-
sions that will soon be coursing through your planet’s grid. Learn about the
human chakra system and subtle energy bodies, for without this knowledge you will
be unable to interact directly with your DNA.  There are many fine books avail-
able through which you can learn how to identify, manipulate and balance
your personal bio-energetic fields. These activities are only the beginning
steps in reclaiming power over your personal genetic code and the evolution
of your consciousness and they will provide you with a rudimentary founda-
tion upon which skills of  Keylontic Science  can be developed. Through
applied Keylontic Science you will discover the methods by which DNA can be
altered from within and you will rediscover your personal power to become Guard-
ians and directors of your personal path of evolution . Becoming the director of
your personal energetic power and the path of evolution your consciousness
will follow, is not only a right, it is your responsibility. We have faith in your
intrinsic integrity and offer our support, encouragement and love to all that
muster the courage to face, rather than turn away from that responsibility.
Each of you will reap the harvests of your own personal choices and you will
join together with others making similar choices, to create a collective reality
field through which your consciousness can evolve. May you choose well and
favor enlightenment instead of darkness, comprehension instead of igno-
rance, freedom instead of blind obedience to forces beyond your perceptions.
You have the ability to become free and powerful, loving and wise. Redis-
cover this promise. Reclaim your power as co-creators within the universal
scheme and use it now, while so much hangs in the balance, awaiting the out-
come of your individual and collective choices.<br />
As we have mentioned, you may be facing tectonic disturbances and the
Earth changes they will create, between now and 2017, when Earth is in its
most vulnerable position. Pay attention to your skies and if you find waves of
mass UFO “ ﬂy-by” sightings, know these are intended to bring you fair warn-
ing, so you have time to prepare for changes in the Earth. If such sightings do
indeed occur, seek telepathic communication with Guardian Visitors or your
own higher self and soul levels of identity, through which you can be guided
to appropriate action. Your lives and the lives of those you love may very well
depend upon your ability to access this higher level guidance. Learn the skills
of interdimensional communication now and how to protect yourselves from
covert manipulation during this practice, for these skills will become tremen-
dously valuable over the next 20 years. There are many books and teachings
available through which you may develop interdimensional communication
skills. Learn from the Light Workers among you, who have already developed
231</p>
<p>Things to Come<br />
proficiency in these areas, for they can teach you much. Those of you who mas-
ter the skills of higher-dimensional internal guidance will not become lost within the
maze of external circumstance and you will be able to retain your personal power in
the face of traumatic events.<br />
If you do not find starships displaying themselves in your skies, consider
yourselves fortunate, for this indicates that your progression through the
ascension cycle will be far less treacherous than it might otherwise have
been. You still need to prepare. Earth will still undergo infusions of UHF
energy that will directly effect the condition of your personal bio-energetic
system, consciousness and physical body. Earth will still shift into the Bridge
Zone and if you have not assembled 4.5 strands of DNA, you will end up on
the Phantom Earth in the D-3 time cycle. You may face covert and overt
invasion by the Dracos-Zeta Resistance and at best you will find yourselves in
need of Soul Matrix Transplants to free you from cycles of fragmented incar-
nation with the D-3 time cycle. All of this can be avoided now, if you take
responsibility for preparing yourselves for the coming changes. Each of you
can “rise to the occasion” if you choose to do so and we believe that you shall.
We believe in you and would not go to such great lengths to educate you, if
this were not the case. You must now re-learn to believe in yourselves and to
break free from the limiting self-concepts that have been imposed upon you
by outside forces and which you have imposed upon yourselves through
accepting limitations without question. You are not victims unless you
choose to be. Choosing ignorance is choosing victim-hood. Your power lies
in the choices you make each moment, in the thoughts you allow yourselves
to entertain, in the actions and events within which you allow yourselves to
participate. Take responsibility for directing your subtle energies and you will
be on your way to personal empowerment.<br />
In closing this book we will provide for you a rudimentary introduction
to the Science of Keylonta, through which you can begin to build a frame-
work of reference for understanding the structures of your subtle energy sys-
tems. In future books we will explore the mechanics of DNA assembly and
activation, offering practical exercises through which you can gain mastery
over this process. The exercises provided within this book are a good place to
begin. Reading alone will not assist you in developing subtle energy skills; it
will only provide the conceptual foundations. The exercises must be used and
practiced to develop pro ficiency. We cannot stress enough the importance of
the times that now approach you, as you move into the 21st century. It is our
hope that you will comprehend the signi ficance of your approaching ascen-
sion opportunity and begin to take action now, to ensure your placement
within your desired future destination. For your convenience we shall now
offer you a brief summary of the ascension schedule and related subjects cov-
ered in these writings.<br />
