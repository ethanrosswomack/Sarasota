          <p>4 Evolutionary Rounds  who are commissioned to run the “Rainbow
Ray” or “Khundaray” Primal Sound Current  from beyond the 15-Di-
mensional Time Matrix, into Earth’s Planetary Shields during SACs .
Running of the Rainbow Ray during SACs enables the planet to retain its
natural electromagnetic balances to avert pole shift and restores the or-
ganic D-12 Planetary Christos Alignment.<br />
• Since the 9558 BC Atlantian Flood , knowledge of the RRTs  has been in-
tentionally  hidden  from the Angelic Human races of contemporary Earth,
by Human Illuminati and Fallen Angelic  races that desire to create pole
shift during the long-anticipated 2000-2017 SAC.  They hope to use the
2000-2017 SAC to finally fulfill their plan of clearing Earth’s real estate”
of Angelic Human races to later resettle their hybrid races on Earth, “after
the dust settles,” under a “One World Order” Anti-Christiac Agenda of
totalitarian exploitation and dominion .

                              THE ATLANTIAN CONSPIRACY
 • The Fallen Angelic/ Illuminati Human Anti-Christiac Agenda gained a
            stronghold on Earth in 25,500 BC when Nibiruian Marduke-Anunnaki
            ( Anunnaki + Omicron  Drakonian) seized control of Nibiru and Earth’s
            D-4 Universal Solar Star Gate-4 , in an event known as the &#39;&#39; Lucifer Re-
              bellion. &#39;&#39; 
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>•  The name  “Lucifer”  comes from a hybrid Pleiadian-Nibiruian Anunnaki
Race that emerged through combining the Density-2 Nibiruian Lulitan
family of the Thoth-Enki-Zephelium (Zeta) Anunnaki lineage with the
Satain  family of the Marduke-Anunnaki line and the D-11 Necromiton
(‘’Beetle-reptile’’) Fallen Seraphim race of Andromeda (most contempo-
rary ‘’ Andromie ‘’ channels  are these). From this hybridization the Pleia-
dian Samjase-Luciferian Anunnaki and Marduke-Necromiton-
Luciferian Anunnaki Races of Sirius B, Nibiru and Alpha and Omega
Centauri emerged. This collective of Anunnaki Races promoting an
Anti-Christiac dominion agenda became known historically as the ‘’ Lu-
c iferians ,’’ and were occasionally joined by other Anunnaki and Illumi-
nati Human race lines in their “Quest for the Holy Grail.”
• The ‘’ Holy Grail ‘’ is a term used in reference to the 1 2 Universal Signet
Star Gates of the Universal Templar Complex,  to which the  Angelic
Human Race holds the Sacred Commission of “ Guardian .” The “Grail
Quest” began long before Angelic Humans were seeded on Earth and it
has been  the primary theme of motivation  behind all of the Forbidden  and<br />
recorded-distorted human history.<br />
• The Grail Quest for Earth’s Planetary Templar Star Gates continued into
Angelic Human 12-Tribes Seeding-3 , following destruction of Seedings-
1 and 2 via Grail Quest Wars with Anunnaki and Drakonian  Fallen An-
gelic Legions. During the 25,500 BC Lucifer Rebellion , Anunnaki Lu-
ciferians gained partial control  over Earth’s Templar through a device
called the Nibiruian Diodic Crystal (NDC) Grid , which is still in oper-
ation today  and serves a key role  in the potential outcome of the 2000-
2017 SAC<br />
• In 22,326 BC the Luciferian Anunnaki races decimated guardian races at-
tempting to intervene in an event known as the Eieyani Massacre, which
took place on the remnants of the Lemurian Continent  now known as
Kauai, Hawaii. In 21,900 BC  they collapsed the Firmament Hydro-sus-
pension Fields of Lohas, northeast Atlantis  in the Lohas-Celtec-Dru-
idec Freeze Out,  in an attempt to destroy the Maji Angelic Human Grail
Kings in exile there; this event gave us our last major glacial period of
21,900 BC-14,000 BC . In 20,000 BC  they staged the Vicherus-Sa-
cheon Invasion of Russia.  In 10,500 BC  the next phase of the Luciferian
dominion plan unfolded in an event called the Luciferian Conquest , at
which time the Atlantian Islands of Nohasa and Bruah  fell to Annu-
Melchizedek Anunnaki-Human hybrid and Fallen Jehovian and Lucifer-

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>• The Anti-Christiac Agenda of the Luciferian Anunnaki Races (not all
Anunnaki are in the “Luciferian” category; some run competing dominion
agendas) was formerly mandated in Bruah Atlantis in 9560 BC  under
an Agreement called the Luciferian Covenant.  The Luciferian Covenant
is part of  3 competing One World Order dominion agendas  collectively
referred to as the Atlantian Conspiracy . The Anunnaki Races of the Lu-
ciferian Covenant orchestrated the “Atlantian Flood” in 9558 BC  and
the intentional “re-writing” of human history  since this time. Forbidden
History reveals a  long-term plot  within which the Anti-Christiac Agen-
gas of the  Atlantian Conspiracy  emerged after the flood  into the  present
day.<br />
•  The Luciferian Covenant continued after the 9558 BC ﬂood in the  8,900
BC “Larsa King” Sumerian Invasion, the 8,400 BC “Scarab King”
Egyptian Invasion , and the 7,500 BC Knights Templar Invasion . The
infiltration continued with the 5,900 BC Centaurian War, when the
Sirius B Maharaji  (Blue Human Guardians) intervened directly with air
raids to prevent Drakonian and Luciferian Forces from claiming world do-
minion. This event is partially documented  in the ancient Hindu text of
the Mahabharata.<br />
• In 3,650 BC  the Nibiruian Luciferians orchestrated the Mayan Raids , and
in 3470 BC the “Babble-On” Massacre  was waged, in which Pleiadian-
Nibiruian  legions, Galactic Federation and the Annu-Melchizedek Hu-
man Illuminati gained temporary control  over the Maji Grail Kings’ “ Arc
of the Covenant  Gold Box ,” which contain the “ Rod and the Staff ” star
gate tools. In conjunction with the Nibiruian-Diodic-Crystal-Grid at
Stonehenge, England, the Arc Tools  were used in Babylon  to cause tem-
porary collapse of Earth’s magnetic grids  and to set portions of the Fire
Letter Sequences  in Earth’s Planetary Shields into reverse sequence.<br />
• Planetary Shield distortions of the 3470 BC “Babble-On” Massacre  caused
mutation in the human DNA Template  that shortened human life span ,
blocked Higher Sensory Perception,  caused loss of  Race Memory and
‘’scrambling ‘’ of our original language patterns,  which are built upon
DNA Template Fire Letter Sequencing . Our race has been amnesiac,
dying young and “babbling on”  in rhetorical con ﬂict ever since. This his-
torical event was recorded  as the Biblical “Tower of Babel”  story.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>               • Following the Babble-On Massacre of 3470 BC, Fallen Angelics selected
        “Chosen Ones, ” Annu-Melchizedek hybrid descendants, for minimal
          DNA Template repair and implantation , through which the Luciferians
      and competing Jehovian-Anunnaki and Drakonian legions could begin
         their progressive infiltration  of human spiritual and political systems.
         Through the technology of remote &#39;&#39; channeling &#39;&#39; conducted through un-
     natural DNA Template implantation,  the “Chosen Ones” have been
     progressively fed Anunnaki History and distorted patriarchal &#39;&#39;War

           the Angelic Human heritage. They are once again &#39;&#39; channeling &#39;&#39; to us
           and visiting today  as the dominant force  in the New Age and UFO
          Movements.

<p>•  Following their 2668 BC Djoser Invasion  of Egypt, Galactic Federation
continued their previous alliance with the Anunnaki of the Luciferian
Covenant, temporarily stealing the Arc of the Covenant Gold Box and
Tools in 2024 BC . At this time they launched an attempted world do-
minion assault  called the Dead Sea Conquest,  beginning with Babylonia
and Sumerian Cities  in the areas of the Dead Sea ; the Biblical stories of
the destruction of “ Sodom and Gomorrah ” referred to this event. “God”
did NOT destroy these ancient cities any more than “God” orchestrated
the scrambling of the languages in the 3470 BC Babble-On Massacre;God
is NOT a Fallen Angelic-ET.  If Maji Grail King Angelic Human Races
had not retrieved the Arc of the Covenant Gold Box and Tools in 2024
BC, the Jehovian and Luciferian Anunnaki Races of the Galactic Fed-
eration  would dominate the world by now.<br />
•  Since the time of the staged 9558 BC  Atlantian ﬂood, human history has
been a progressive advancement  of the Atlantian Conspiracy and Lu-
ciferian Covenant  Anti-Christos Agendas. The stories of Noah, Abra-
ham, Moses, the Hyksos Kings and the ‘’3  Christs ‘’ are key pieces to the
Atlantian Conspiracy drama. At the center of this drama are the Arc of
the Covenant Gold Box,  its star gate tools  and the core objective  of the
ancient Fallen Angelic/ Illuminati Human Grail Quest.<br />
•  Competing Jehovian-Anunnaki, Luciferian Anunnaki and Omicron , Od-
edicron and Zephelium (Zeta) Drakonian/Reptilian Fallen Angelics  and
their Annu-Melchizedek Illuminati Human hybrid race descendants¹
share one objective-dominion of Earth, in order to claim Earth’s Halls
of Amenti Star Gates.<br />
•  If the Fallen Angelic races can gain dominion of Earth’s Halls of Amenti
Star Gates, they intend to use the Amenti Star Gates to destroy Univer-
sal Star Gate-12 in Density-4.  Destruction of Universal Star Gate-12
would effectively seal off from Density-5 Founders Race protection,  11-
dimensions  of our 15-Dimensional Time Matrix. The manifest life field
would become “imprisoned in time” for Fallen Angelic exploitation and
dominion, unable to fulfill the natural evolutionary process of ascension.
This is the core motivation behind the Fallen Angelics’ continuing Grail
Quest. Prevention  of this Anti-Christos Agenda is the purpose for which
the Angelic Human Race  was created 560 million years ago.<br />
• To accomplish their objective of claiming Earth and the Amenti Star Gates,
Fallen Angelics need to possess the Arc of the Covenant Gold Box and
star gate tools , and to achieve critical mass population  of their hybrid-
human races, whose DNA Templates  carry reverse sequenced Fire Let-
ters.  During a Stellar Activations Cycle , the Arc Tools, the still-func-
tioning Nibiruian-Diodic-Crystal Grid  (from 25,500 BC), Nibiruian

           be used to create intentional pole shift  on Earth to &#39;&#39;clear the real estate.&#39;&#39;
 •  If they can successfully exterminate Angelic Human Races from Earth, the
         Luciferian and Jehovian Anunnaki Races intend to return their &#39;&#39;Chosen
          Ones&#39;&#39;Annu-Melchizedek descendant humans to Earth during the SAC.
          The “Chosen Ones”  will be used  to run critical mass reversed Fire Let-
          ter Sequences  into Earth’s Planetary Shields  and the Amenti Star Gates
             in fulfillment of the Anunnaki Anti-Christos Grail Quest Agenda. This
            plan was formalized in the  9560 BC Luciferian Covenant  and has been
               progressively unfolding . Since 9560 BC the anticipated date  for the Final
          Con ﬂict and intended, orchestrated pole shift  has been the 2000-2017
          SAC.  Now.  
      • Many times throughout the advancement of the Atlantian Conspiracy,
            Guardian Races of the Emerald Covenant have repeatedly intervened.
              Guardian races have kept the Angelic Human and Maji Grail Line
           DNA Templates  alive within the human gene pool,  so Angelic Humans
            could rise together  during the 2000-2017 BC Final Conflict drama , to
            fulfill the Christos Realignment Mission and prevent further advance-
           ment of the Atlantian Conspiracy.  
• During the Christ Drama of 12 BC-27  AD the Founders’ Emerald Cove-
                 nant  CDT-Plate teachings  were translated by the 3 Maji Grail Line
             Speakers,  Jesheua Melchizedek  (aka Jesus Christ), John the Baptist and
                 Miriam, to prepare humanity  for the 2000-2017 Final Conflict.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>• The heart of the 12 BC-27 AD Christ Drama  was not only CDT-Plate
teachings; Jesheua, John, Miriam and a group of Maji Grail Line Angelic
Humans were on a Emerald Covenant Grail Quest Mission to secure
Earth’s Star Gate-11  from Anunnaki and Drakonian Race infiltration.
Both Luciferian and Jehovian Anunnaki Races, and their Annu-
Melchizedek Illuminati descendants seek to claim the Arc of the Cove-
nant Gold Box and star gate tools to  take control of Earth’s Star Gate-
11, for use in  imploding Universal Star Gate-12  during the 2000-2017
BC Stellar Activations Cycle . This plan was known since the success of
the 25,500 BC Lucifer Rebellion.<br />
• Jesheua and his Universal Templar Security Team intended to use the Arc
of the Covenant Gold Box star gate tools  (“Rod and Staff”) to release
Anunnaki Nibiruian Diodic Crystal Grid Crystal  control over Earth’s
Templar and Solar Star Gate-4. The mission of Jesheua, John, Miriam and
the Maji was intended to prepare the Angelic Humans of Earth to fulfill
the Christos Realignment Mission  during the anticipated 2000-2017
SAC . In 23 AD  Jesheua and his Maji were attacked by the Annu-
Melchizedek Hyksos and Hassa Leviathan King  races, in an event called
the Essene Divide , which rendered them unable to fully complete  their
intended journey to the lands previously known as northern Lohas At-
lantis , the location of Earth’s Star Gate-11.<br />
•  To protect the Arc of the Covenant Gold Box and star gate tools, John and<br />
Miriam completed part of the journey  to Lohas, burying the Arc of the
Covenant Gold Box and tools in the area now known as the Vale of Pew-

  sey, England.  Jesheua and his group of Maji served as a Signet Council , a
    group of Angelic Human Maji commissioned to &#39;&#39; Run the RRT &#39;&#39; prepar-
   ing Earth’s Planetary Shields for the 2000-2017 SAC.  
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>• The CDT-Plate teachings  of these 3 Essene Emerald Covenant Speakers
contained the Planetary Templar Mechanics  by which the Planetary
Christos Realignment could be achieved in the 2000-2017 SAC. These
teachings were later stolen, edited and falsified int o a Religious Control
Dogma in 325 AD , by the Council of Nicaea and the Drakonian Infil-
trated Church of Rome;  the falsified CDT-Plate  teachings of Jesheua,
John and Miriam were interwoven with Annu-Melchizedek Leviathan
King Anunnaki history  to create the Canonized Bible.<br />
• The Mission of Jesheua, John and Miriam later resumed between 559-608
AD,  when the ‘’ Quest for the Holy Grail ‘’ the Atlantian Conspiracy
and the hunt for the Arc of the Covenant Gold Box and star gate tools
continued in the drama of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round-
table.<br />
KING A RTHUR AND THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUNDTABLE
•  King Arthurus , or “Arthur” was born from a Druidec Maji Grail King lin-
eage  originally from Nohasa and later exiled to Lohas Atlantis.  Arthur
and his selected Signet Council “Knights”  were commissioned to fulfill
the 10 AD-27 AD Emerald Covenant Mission that Jesheua, John the Bap-
tist, Miriam and the Essene Maji were unable to complete due to the Hyk-
sos-Hassa King raids in the 23 AD Essene Divide. Arthur’s legendary
sword ‘’Excalibur ‘’ was a battle sword fashioned to hold the Staff star
gate tool  from the Arc of the Covenant Gold Box,  which Arthur and
Victorous  (son of Meridan) retrieved from the Vale of Pewsey  in En-
gland, where John and Miriam had buried it in 23 AD.</p>
<p>• Victorous , son of Meridan , came to be known as “ Merlin ” Arthur’s Vizier
and court mystic in the Arthur Legends. Victorous’ father Meridan was a
Knights Templar Annu-Melchizedek  Black Arts Occultist, his mother
was of a Celtec Maji Grail King line  originally from Lohas Atlantis. Vic-
torous’ life and service to King Arthur were overshadowed by the struggle
of “good vs. evil” that existed within his genetic programming.<br />
• Arthur’s wife  Guinevere  was of a Celtec Maji Grail King  line originally
from Lohas Atlantis. Guinevere’s sister Saleane , not Guinevere, was the
lover of Arthur’s imposter Knight “ Sir Lancelot, ’’ a Luciferian Knights
Templar sent in to sabotage the Emerald Covenant Mission. Knights
Templar Annu-Melchizedek races intentionally distorted  true Arthurian
period history. Teachings of the RRTs and Star Gate Signet Councils
were hidden in occult secret societies of the Knights Templar. The histor-
ical  realities  of the Maji Grail King lineage and Arthur’s Emerald Cov-
enant Mission were intentional “ re-written Nibiruian Anunnaki
style ,” romanticizing Victorous (‘’Merlin’’) and other characters that as-
sisted the Knights Templar in undermining Arthur’s  Emerald Covenant
Mission .<br />
