          <p>12 Seed Crystal Seals governs the function of the DNA Seed Codes within
the 12-strand DNA imprint; one Seed Crystal Seal directs the Seed Code of
one strand of DNA. The Star Crystal Seals of the bio-energetic body also cor-
respond to the DNA. Within the morphogenetic imprint for human DNA
there are dormant gene codes that correspond to the Star Crystal Seals; as
long as the Star Crystal Seals are not activated, these gene codes will remain
dormant. Each Star Crystal Seal is composed of half of the frequency patterns
of the dimension above it and half of those from the dimension below.<br />
There are 12 dormant DNA  codes corresponding to 12 Star Crystal
Seals and each code carries the frequencies and light spectra contained
within the Star Crystal Seal. These dormant gene codes allow for the sepa-
rate DNA strands to “plug into each other”, a condition necessary for Cellu-
lar Transmutation. The 12 dormant gene codes corresponding to 12 of the 15
Star Crystal Seals are individually referred to as Genetic Time Codes, Codes
of Transmutation or  Fire Codes . Collectively the 12 Fire Codes are known as
the Silicate Matrix  or the Crystal Gene. This is the original gene construc-
tion of the human organism.<br />
Due to various genetic mutations, a very small percentage of humans
presently carry the entire Silicate Matrix in the personal morphogenetic
imprint for the DNA. Through distortions within the DNA Seed Codes, the
Fire Codes of the Silicate Matrix break down and can no longer function.
Without the functional Silicate Matrix, the Star Crystal Seals of the bio-
energetic body cannot activate and thus the body cannot achieve cellular
transmutation. Without operational Fire Codes, the body becomes locked
within its dimensional space-time station. The Fire Codes of the Silicate

</div>
<p>Matrix are restored to f unction through correcting distortions within the
DNA Seed Codes; as the Seed Codes are repaired, the Fire Codes reassemble.
During the upcoming ascension period and through the birth of the Six
Silent Ascension Avatars who will realign the DNA imprint, the distorted
DNA Seed Codes will be corrected in the race morphogenetic field, making
it possible for large numbers of people to reverse-mutate their DNA strands.
This reverse-mutation will allow for the Fire Codes of the Silicate Matrix to
begin re-assembly in people who do not carry this imprint, restoring the
body’s ability to activate the Star Crystal Seals and achieve cellular transmu-
tation.<br />
This process will not take place automatically . It requires conscious par-
ticipation to prepare the body for these changes. The Higher Self and Soul
level aspects of personal identity will do much of the work, but the choices of
the conscious personality will have great bearing upon the outcome of these
multidimensional processes. Every thought and activity will either assist the
Higher Self in preparing for these changes or detract from its efforts to do so.
In subsequent books we of the Guardian Alliance will provide exercises
through which you can begin to consciously participate in this process. For
now we would simply like you to become acquainted with these hidden
dynamics of the science of ascension.<br />

<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Seed Crystal Seals:  Minute crystalline frequency seals within each chakra
and auric field level of the 15-dimensional human bio-energetic field, that
keep particles and anti-particles in one dimension separated from each
other. Each Seed Crystal Seal corresponds to the frequency bands of one
dimension and directs the function of one DNA strand that corresponds
to that dimension. One Seed Crystal Seal separates the particle and anti-
particle units of the DNA strand, keeping the body’s particle base polar-
ized and locked into that dimensional band.<br />
The separation of particle and anti-particle caused by the Seed Crystal
Seal keeps the body’s particle base locked into the time continuum and
particle pulsation rhythm characteristic to that dimension. The Seed
Crystal Seals control particle pulsation rhythm, keeping it consistent with
the pulsation rhythm of the dimensional band in which the Seed Crystal
Seal is located. The Seed Crystal Seals control the speed at which the
Dimensional Merkaba Fields spin. Release of a Seed Crystal Seal allows
the particles and anti-particles of one dimension to fuse and to accelerate
in pulsation rhythm, causing the Dimensional Merkaba Field to accelerate
its speed of rotation.<br />

</li>
</ol>
<p>When  the body’s particles in one dimension fuse and accelerate and the
rotation speed of the Merkaba Field increases, the Star Crystal Seal
between that dimensional band and the dimensional band above releases.
Seed Crystal Seals are considered Horizontal Seals, as they control the
horizontal movement of frequency bands, light spectra and particles in
one dimension. There are nine Seed Crystal Seals located at the center of
nine primary chakras within the structure of the physical body and six
located at the center of chakra centers outside of the physical body, for a
total of 15 Seed Crystal Seals within the design of multidimensional
human anatomy.<br />
2.   DNA Seed Codes—Base Codes And Acceleration Codes:  Units of
minute crystalline frequency that form the morphogenetic templates for
DNA strands. The template for one DNA strand is composed of 12 mag-
netic particle units and 12 electrical anti-particle units. The 12 magnetic
particle units are called Base Codes. The 12 electrical anti-particle units
are called Acceleration Codes.<br />
Each DNA strand is composed of the frequency patterns and light spectra
of one dimensional band. All aspects of human DNA are built upon this
morphogenetic template of 12 Base Codes and 12 Acceleration Codes.
The DNA Base Codes in one DNA strand represent the 12 magnetic base
tone frequencies of one dimension that corresponds to that strand and the
DNA Acceleration Codes represent the 12 electrical overtone frequencies
contained in one dimensional band. The electrical overtone frequencies
of a dimension correspond to the magnetic base tone frequencies of that
dimension’s anti-particle counterpart in the parallel universe.<br />
The 24 Seed Codes of one DNA strand serve to set the body’s particle and
anti-particle content into the dimensional band corresponding to that
DNA strand, in both the particle and anti-particle universe. Each set of
Base Codes and Acceleration Codes in one DNA strand is controlled by
one Seed Crystal Seal, which serves to keep the particle Base Codes and
anti-particle Acceleration Codes of the DNA strand separate, thereby
maintaining the body’s particle base within the pulsation rhythms of that
dimension. Release of the Seed Crystal Seal allows Base Codes and Accel-
eration Codes in the DNA to fuse or “plug into each other” and accelerate
in pulsation rhythm. This allows the body’s particle and anti-particle base
in that dimension to fuse and accelerate in pulsation rhythm.<br />
The fusion of DNA Base Codes and Acceleration Codes causes minute
crystalline structures to manifest within the molecular structure of the
blood, which prepares the body’s bio-chemical, cellular, hormonal and
metabolic systems for acceleration of particle rhythm and transmutation.
Dimensional particle rhythm acceleration causes the Star Crystal Seal

between that dimension and the dimension above to release. Release of a
Star Crystal Seal activates a dormant Genetic Time Code or Fire Code
within the two DNA strands corresponding to that Star Crystal Seal.
3.   Star Crystal Seals: Minute crystalline frequency seals between chakras
and auric field levels within the 15-dimensional bio-energetic human
body, that keep particles and anti-particles from one dimensional band
separate from those in the dimensional bands above and below.
Each Star Crystal Seal corresponds to and is composed of the frequency
bands from the dimension above and from the dimension below the Star
Crystal Seal. The Star Crystal Seal directs the interaction between the
two DNA strands that correspond to the dimensions above and below the
Star Crystal Seal. One Star Crystal Seal separates the particles and anti-
particles in one dimension from the particles and anti-particles in the
dimension above, another separates the particles and anti-particles in that
dimension from those in the dimension below.
The Star Crystal Seals keep the particle fields of the three-dim ensional
body and multidimensional consciousness separate by controlling the
angular rotation of particle spin between the 15 dimensions. The separa-
tion of particle fields into three-dimensional groupings, which the Star
Crystal Seals create, keeps the particle content of the body locked into the
three-dimensional field of one Harmonic Universe. The Star Crystal Seals
control the angle at which the personal Dimensional Merkaba Fields will
rotate and thus also control the body’s relationship to the Harmonic
Merkaba Field (the three-dimensional Merkaba Field of one Harmonic
Universe). Release of a Star Crystal Seal allows the personal Dimensional
Merkaba Fields to align on a vertical axis with the Harmonic Merkaba
Field , which causes the Harmonic Merkaba Field rotation to accelerate,
aligning it with the Merkaba Field of the three-dimensional Harmonic
Universe above. Release of the Star Crystal Seal also allows the particles
and anti-particles in one three-dimensional field to merge, fuse and trans-
mute into the dimensional bands of the Harmonic Universe above.
As a Star Crystal Seal releases, a dormant DNA code called a Genetic
Time Code or ﬁre code activates within the two DNA strands correspond-
ing to the Star Crystal Seal. Star Crystal Seals are considered Vertical
Seals, as they control the vertical movement of frequency bands, light
spectra and particles between dimensions. There are nine Star Crystal
Seals located within the structure of the human body, and six located
within the multidimensional bio-energetic body (outside of the physical
structure), for a total of 15 Star Crystal Seals within the design of multidi-
mensional human anatomy.

<p>quency within the dimensional morphogenetic imprint for the DNA that
link DNA strands together and allow for cellular transmutation, teleporta-
tion, time travel and dimensional ascension to take place. Also referred to
as Codes of Transmutation or Genetic Time Codes. One DNA Fire Code
corresponds to each Star Crystal Seal. Each DNA strand contains half of
the Fire Code that corresponds to the Star Crystal Seal from the dimen-
sional band above the dimensional band to which the DNA strand corre-
sponds. It also contains half of the Fire Code corresponding to the Star
Crystal Seal from the dimensional band below that corresponding to the
strand.<br />
The DNA Fire Codes allow one DNA strand to “plug into” and fuse with
another. When DNA strands fuse, the Base Codes and Acceleration
Codes of one strand merge with those of the strand above, fusing particles
and anti-particles between dimensional bands. This allows the three parti-
cle bases of a three-dimensional human body to merge, the separation
between them dissolving. When the three-dimensional particle bases of a
body in one Harmonic Universe merge, the particles and anti-particles are
able to rapidly accelerate pulsation rhythm, turn into light waves and
transmute into the dimensional bands of the Harmonic Universe above.
The Fire Codes activate when their corresponding Star Crystal Seals
release.<br />
Once activated, the Fire Codes rapidly accelerate the assembly and activa-
tion of the Base Codes and Acceleration Codes of the strands to which
the Fire Code is attached. The Seed Crystal Seal in the next chakra up
then releases and particles and anti-particles within the dimensional band
corresponding to that Seed Crystal Seal fuse, activating the next Star
Crystal Seal. When the Fire Codes activate, the blood crystals (formed by
the release of successive Seed Crystal Seals), merge, forming complex
blood crystal structures, which carry the frequency patterns of three
dimensions. The three-dimensional blood crystals trigger further bio-
chemical, cellular, hormonal and metabolic acceleration. This biological
acceleration allows the body to raise the rhythm of particle pulsation and
shift the angular rotation of particle spin. The three smaller dimensional
Merkaba Fields of the body merge and open into the Harmonic Merkaba
Field, which then merges with the Harmonic Merkaba Field of the Har-
monic Universe above. The body cells accelerate, transmute into light
then re-manifest within the three-dimensional field of the Harmonic Uni-
verse above.<br />
There are 12 Fire Codes dormant within the original human 12-strand
DNA imprint, each corresponding to one of 12 Star Crystals. The 12 Fire
Codes are collectively referred to as the Silicate Matrix or Crystal Gene-
481</p>
<p>Ascension Cycle Dynamics<br />
the Gene of Transmutation. The  Fire Codes break down through distor-
tion in the DNA Seed Codes and become dysfunctional until the DNA
Seed Codes are realigned. The Star Crystal Seals of the bio-energetic body
cannot release unless the Silicate Matrix is operational.<br />
DNA Mutations and the Ascension Cycle<br />
Prior to mutation of the human genetic code, the process of Seed Crystal
Seal, Star Crystal Seal and Fire Code activation happened automatically as a
natural part of the biological evolutionary process. As the morphogenetic
field drew in frequency from the dimensional Uni fied Fields, progressively
assembling those frequencies into the DNA imprint then activating the
imprint through manifesting a corresponding DNA strand, the Seed Crystal
Seals would naturally release. Then the next Star Crystal Seal would release
and the DNA Fire Code would activate, progressively transmuting the cellu-
lar structure into less dense states of matter. The body systems were under
conscious control and the Immortal Human could choose desired time-space
placement by consciously altering the personal Merkaba Fields, bio-energetic
structure and particle pulsation rhythm. Presently these processes do not
operate as they were intended due to various DNA strand distortions and
mutations.<br />
The coming ascension period of 2012-2017 offers humanity a rare
opportunity to rapidly reverse-mutate these genetic distortions, realign the
DNA imprint with its original 12-strand pattern and accelerate the evolution
of biology and consciousness by thousands of years. Humans who do not
make the shift to Bridge Zone Earth will not have this opportunity again, for
the Stellar Merkaba Spirals do not fully align with the Merkaba Fields of a
Descending planet. The DNA of humans on the Descending Phantom Earth
will undergo another mutation; the DNA will be unable to assemble beyond
the third strand and portions of the fourth strand that had begun to assemble
will dismantle and de-activate. This genetic mutation can be remedied only
through a Host Matrix Transplant, through which a Soul Matrix from HU-2
allows the HU-1 incarnate to energetically and genetically braid into its Soul
Matrix morphogenetic field. Individuals of Phantom Earth who do not have
Host Matrix Transplants will find their genetic codes, bodies and conscious-
ness deteriorating over several generations until the ability to reproduce is
lost. Cloning tactics further reduce the genetic imprint and ultimately will
not preserve the species. This is precisely the condition that occurred within
the Zeta race strains.<br />
Due to the Stellar Spiral Alignments, Stellar Activations and Stellar
Wave Infusions of the ascension period, the process of cellular transmutation
can be brie ﬂy called into action. This will allow for a self-generated bio-ener-
getically induced transmutative evacuation from Phantom Earth to take
place, for those who participate in the Stellar Activation process. The DNA

<p>strand mutations will be cleared from the race morphogenetic field of the
Sphere of Amenti and the corrected imprint will be transmitted through
Earth’s grid into the bio-energetic fields of humans who have prepared their
system to receive these energies.<br />
The frequencies carried on the Stellar Spirals can then create activation
and release of the Star Crystal Seals, which will allow the Seed Crystal Seals
to open and the DNA Fire Codes to activate. Through this Star Crystal Seal
Activation process, the particle pulsation rhythms of the body and conscious-
ness can be accelerated and the DNA rapidly assembled and activated, so
individuals may shift into the Bridge Zone or Taran time cycles. Each of the
upcoming six Transmutative Stellar Activations will allow various Star Crys-
tal Seals to release and DNA strands to activate. A minimum of 1.5 Stellar
Activations must occur for an individual to successfully shift into the Bridge
Zone. Those who do not make the shift will end up on Phantom Earth in the
D-3 time cycle after 2017. Reincarnation out of HU-1 will require a Host
Matrix Transplant.<br />
Releasing of the Star Crystal Seals of the human body is a complicated
process of multidimensional physics. We do not have enough time to teach
you of the intricacies involved in this process. For this reason our future work
will focus upon bio-energetic techniques you can use to facilitate the process,
rather than on laborious conceptual foundations such as those presented in
this book. It is important that you comprehend the basic concepts of these
energetic dynamics so future exercises will make some bit of rational sense to
you. To take this opportunity for accelerated evolution, you simply need to
know how to use your mind to direct frequency. You also need to know what
frequencies are available at what times via the Stellar Spirals, how to bring
these frequencies into your bodies and where to direct them once you have
drawn them in.<br />
Frequencies from the Stellar Spirals are drawn into your body via the
higher-dimensional chakras; the chakra centers located outside of the body
that are primarily dormant at this time and do not transmit frequency directly
into the lower, in-body chakras. By intention you can use the Stellar Spiral
frequencies to activate these higher chakra centers, then draw energy from
the Spirals through the activated chakras into the lower chakras and the
appropriate Star Crystal Seals.<br />
483</p>
<p>Ascension Cycle Dynamics
You must know:
A. What Stellar Spirals carry what frequencies and when the Spiral aligns with Earth,
making those frequencies available.</p>
<p>B. Where your higher and lower chakras and Star Crystal Seals are located, what
frequencies each chakra can draw in and how the chakras correspond to the Star Crystal
Seals you need to activate.
The in-body chakras of 1-7 correspond to the frequency bands of dimen-
sions 1-7. The higher-dimensional chakras that correspond to dimensions 9-
15 are called Morphogenetic Chakras, as they open into and draw energy
from the morphogenetic fields of dimensions 1-7, which are correspondingly
located in dimensions 9-14.<br />
The lower dimensions and chakras are linked to the higher dimensions
and morphogenetic chakras through the Meta-galactic Core at D-8 and the
eighth chakra; the activated eighth chakra allows you to draw frequency from
the morphogenetic chakras down into the lower chakra centers.<br />
T o activate certain Star Crystal Seals you will open the morphogenetic
chakra that corresponds to the lower chakras with which that Seal is associ-
ated, then draw frequency from the morphogenetic chakra into the Star
Crystal Seal.<br />
It is not difficult to do once you understand the correspondences between
the lower chakras, their Star Crystal Seals and the morphogenetic chakras.
