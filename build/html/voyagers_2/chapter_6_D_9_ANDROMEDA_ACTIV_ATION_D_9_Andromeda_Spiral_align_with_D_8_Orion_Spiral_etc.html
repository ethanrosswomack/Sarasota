 FIELD TECHNIQUE 1: EXERCISE TO RELEASE CRYSTALLIZED
                    THOUGHT PATTERNS FROM THE DNA
                       AND CELLULAR MEMORY IMPRINT
</pre></div>

<p>• By moving the focus of your conscious attention into a slower-moving pul-
sation pattern, you will be able to release the thought patterns stored with-
in your cells. When you relax your mental focus and slow your heart and
breathing rates, your consciousness expands and begins to pulsate faster,
while the pulsation rhythm of your body’s particles slows. From this
quickened state of consciousness, you can then consciously shift the par-
ticle-pulsation speed of your awareness into very slow pulsation rhythms.
• First, you will visualize moving your consciousness through a dark tunnel, with a
bright light at its end (the same effect as in a Near Death Experience, which
occurs for the following reason). Moving into the light represents the
quickening of the particle pulsation rhythm of your consciousness, for
which you are aiming in this exercise. You perceive the “dark tunnel” as
your consciousness moves from its D-4 pulsation rhythm, through  the 90°
shift in angular rotation of particle spin that exists between the D-4 and
D-5 frequency bands, and into the faster pulsation rhythms of D-5 fre-
quency. The “light at the end of the tunnel” represents the collective re-
ality fields of the D-5 frequency bands, (and the D-5 consciousn ess
contained there within), as viewed in condensed form, by consciousness
stationed in lower dimensions. One moves closer to the light as the par-
ticle pulsation rhythm of the consciousness accelerates to the rhythm of
the D-5 frequency bands. The light will appear to take on spherical form,
like a blazing sun, as the consciousness nears the D-5 pulsation rhythm.
One merges with the light when the consciousness has reached D-5 pul-
sation rhythm. This is the process you will encounter after death, but it
can be used consciously while you are still in body, for many different pur-
poses. When you perceive the light you are seeing the fifth dimension.
• Once visualizing yourself in the light, submerge yourself within it and feel that light
move through every cell in your body, imagine it moving through your DNA.
This raises the pulsation rhythm of the body’s particles by infusing them

<p>within the D-5 frequency patterns carried by your accelerated conscious-
ness, bringing what is stored within the cells closer to the range of your
conscious perception. When you view your body from this D-5 state of
consciousness, you will notice areas of the body that appear quite light
filled, and others that appear dark. The dark areas represent parts of the
body in which slower-pulsating particles are stored, the dark areas are the
karmic imprints you seek to release.
•  Next, move your attention into one of the dark areas as fully as possible, feel its
sensations and become aware of the pulsation rhythm of the energy in that inter-
nal space. It will have a distinct feel of rhythm that you can detect if you
move your attention into i t.
• Become aware of the difference between the pulsation rate of your con-
sciousness and that of the dark area, then  consciously slow the pulsation rate
of your consciousness to match that of the dark area. Feel yourself moving
down into the blackness of the dark space, slowing the rhythm of your
consciousness, spreading out, and becoming one with the area. As you
proceed to move your consciousness into the area, you will feel a distinct
sensation of the stopping of expansion. This occurs when your conscious-
ness has fully expanded itself into the morphogenetic field of t hat dark
area thought-form. You have become one with the thought pattern, you
are the pattern. You do not have to identify the contents of the thought
pattern in order to release it, though you may begin to receive ideas, im-
ages or emotional qualities from the thought-form as you proceed through
this exercise. Let the impressions pass by your attention, and keep focused
on the exercise. In merging your awareness with the dark thought-form,
you have moved the station of your consciousness from the D-4 level,
through the D-5 level and down into the frequency bands in which that
thought-form originated. You have entered its source of creation and
merged your identity with that of the identity who created the pattern.
You have become the creator of the thought pattern. Being its creator, you
can now change it.¹
• Once you have become one with the crystallized thought-form, sense the
shape and boundaries of its energy structure. It will have a form and struc-
ture of energy that you can “feel out” with your consciousness.
• Feel your awareness expand into every layer of the energy form, as if you are fill-
ing a balloon with water or a box with sand, until you can feel your con-
sciousness take up every inch of area within the structure of the thought-
form. Once you feel completely expanded into the thought-form, begin
to recreate it.

<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> Field Technique 1: Exercise to Release Crystallized Thought Patterns
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>• Call light to yourself. Imagine that you can see light streaming in from a beam
above you, as if there was a sun positioned above your consciousness.
• Breathe light from that sun, into your consciousness and feel it make the pulsation
rhythm of the thought-form and your consciousness move faster. See the dark
area that is presently “you” become more and more light filled. Begin to
hear the sound pitch of the energy in the thought-form and hear its fre-
quency raise, as more and more light enters the thought-form. Allow the
sound and sensation of expanding light to fill your entire consc iousness,
and continue to draw light in, until you sense a distinct stop to the sensa-
tion of light expanding. The thought-form has now reached its maximum
holding capacity for UHF energy.
• Now, imagine that the sun above you is moving down, into your consciousness
and the thought-form. When the sun enters the thought-form, the thought-
form explodes and the crystalline energy substance, of which its morpho-
genetic field was made, literally blows apart. The thought-form no longer
exists as a reality within your body or consciousness, its particles of energy
substance have been released. The energetic reality of this process is that
of using inner light (visualizations) to guide UHF sound patterns into a
thought-form morphogenetic field. The UHF sound patterns literally
shatter the energy structure of the thought-form, breaking apart the crys-
tallization of slower-pulsating energy particles, just as certain tones of
sound can cause a glass to shatter in the physical world. Through engaging
in this process, you are literally merging the slower-pulsating crystallized
particles with their anti-particles, through the thought-form of the sun
that you created during the visualization. That “sun” image translates
through your body consciousness as D-5 through D-8 frequency, the fre-
quency bands of transmutation through which particle and anti-particle
merge. When you merge multidimensional particles and anti-particles you
create photons. Through this exercise you have created a burst of photo-
nic energy within the frequency bands in which the thought-form crystal-
lization had been.
• To conclude this exercise , focus upon the image of the sun causing the thought-
form to explode. Imagine that you can feel this explosion within your body as a
sudden burst of energy that runs through your cells from the area in the body
where the dark area had been. Visualize this occurring, and see that the dark area
is now ﬁlled with radiating light. You may not have to imagine the sensation
of energy rushing through you at all, for this is the energetic reality of what
is taking place. The degree to which you can sense this energy release will
depend upon how sensitized your neurological structure is to higher fre-
quency energy. This sensitivity will increase the more you engage your
consciousness in activities such as this exercise. Exercises like this activate
dormant DNA codes, which program the body to build new neuro-pas-
sageways and nerve endings. This increases the body’s ability to sense sub-<br />
tle energy and expands the perceptual range of consciousness while it is<br />
focused in the body.</p>
<p>• As you visualize photonic light running through your body , consciously guide
that light directly into the DNA, while holding the intention that the body will
use this energy to accelerate the DNA-building process, under the direction of<br />
495</p>
<p>Field Techniques
the soul matrix identity. Visualize minute photonic particles moving into and ad-
hering to your double helix DNA strands, until you perceive all of the light par-
ticles that were released, as merging with your DNA.
• Complete the exercise  by visualizing your consciousness returning into the bright
light sun, then move your awareness backward through the dark tunnel until it
is focused in your present moment station of consciousness.
FIELD TECHNIQUE 2: THE MAHARIC SEAL
• The teachings of the Guardian Alliance are vested in the Law of One; the
interconnection, and Interdependence , of all dimensions of “reality”…
and the Living God, or Spirit, alive within all things.
• All Guardian Alliance teachings are “state of the art,” and specifically ac-
knowledge the scientific/ energetic foundations of “Oneness,” together
with clear emphasis on the unification of science with Spirit, t he “Chris-
tos Within,” and the absolute association with Esoteric Metaphysical Or-
der.
• The practical purpose of these teachings is to truly free and empower all,
through expanded consciousness and educated enlightenment, through
which reverence, respect, love and co-operative co-creation are fostered
within the Global Community. These perspectives fully embrace geo-
physical planetary healing as an intrinsic consequence of personal align-
ment and expansion.
• The personal-planetary technique given here is a key-stone tool of such im-
portance that it is made freely available to everyone. Like all Temple tech-
niques and tools, the Maharic Seal is grounded firmly in Univers al
Unified Field physics, ancient Merkaba Mechanics and Matter Template
Science (a.k.a. the “Divine Blueprint”).
•These techniques are known as “ Bio-Regenesis Technologies”  which were once
common knowledge, taught in the Pre-Ancient Mystery Schools of ad-
vanced human cultures; these were regarded as standard, as well as essen-
tial, daily practice.
• The Maharic Seal , like all Bio-Regenesis Technologies , implies application of
speciﬁc conscious energy, directed to, and within, the core manifestation
template of the body. This technique directly activates the specific math-
ematical -geometrical relationship within, and between, the  Angelic Hu-
man and the planetary, organic, evolutionary blueprint utilizing the
hydroplasmic frequencies of the 10th, 11th and l2th Dimensional “ Maha-
ra Current .” The Maharic Current was fully re-anchored on this planet for
the first time in about 210,000 years, at the GRU-AL point, Sarasota, FL,
Signet 2 point of the Planetary Templar Grid, on May 5, 2000.
• The Maharic Seal  is a major tool by which the purpose, intention, awareness
and effect of the Angelic Human  can be significantly accelerated in a gen-
uine, substantial and high impact fashion.

and sacred site work;
• Trigger DNA activations which progressively and automatically activate
the full Merkaba;
• Enable healers to transmit 12D frequency sub-harmonics, providing more
powerful, longer lasting (often permanent) healing facilitation -free of
personal and client energetic field distortions;
• Protect users from “disharmonic” energies associated with “channeling,”
healing, Astral projection, and other means of personal field infiltration;
• Assist Indigo Type III children anchor the higher frequencies which cause
fractious behavior (administered via parent);
• Amplify the results of spiritually focused activity;
• Harmonize personal &amp; environmental energies;
• Create Morphogenetic Re-patterning , clearing karmic / miasmic imprints<br />
which otherwise block DNA activation (and the attainment of true con-
sciousness expansion and full embodiment of the “Christos Principle’’);
• Realign, revitalize and regenerate all aspects of the physical and subtle body
systems;
• Trigger activation of 11th and 12th sub-harmonics in every DNA strand
which assists correction of code reversal and the effects of interaction with
other code mutated partners;
• Prepare and equip practitioners to receive and hold the increas ing ﬂow of
higher frequency energies ﬂowing into the Planetary Grids and personal
morphogenetic fields arising from the intensifying Stellar Activation Cy-
cle now underway (2000-20l7).

<p>Temporary Maharic Seal Technique Steps
Short Version of the Maharic Seal™ Bio-field Clearing, Alignment and Pro-
tection Technique from the Kathara Bio-Spiritual Healing System ™
Program . For temporary restoration and maintenance of personal Bio-
Field Integrity and Physical Revitalization.</p>
<p>Prior to use: Read through  the steps and practice the visualizations and their se-
quence slowly,  for familiarity.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Imagine the two-dimensional image of a “Merkaba Star” or six-pointed
“Star of David,” in the color of Pale Silver, as if the image is drawn on a
black background on the inside of your forehead. This image represents a
composite scalar wave pattern Keylontic Symbol Code called the “Hi-
erophant.” Its color denotes the frequency spectra of the 11th and 12th
Dimensions, and its form, combined with these color frequencies, repre-
sents the control code of the l2th dimensional frequency band. It is the
Key Code to unlock the 12th Dimensional Maharic Shield in the personal
and planetary scalar grids.</p></li>
<li><p>Inhale , while visualizing the Hierophant Symbol at the center of the brain,
in the Pineal Gland.</p></li>
<li><p>Exhale, while using the exhale breath to firmly move the Hierophant down
the Central Vertical Body Current (energy current in the center of the
body), then out between the legs and straight down into the Earth’s core
(your 13th Chakra).</p></li>
<li><p>Inhale, while imagining that you can see at Earth’s core a huge, Disc-shaped
Crystalline Platform of Pale Silver Light that extends outward on a hori-
zontal plane through the entire body of the Earth and out into the atmo-
sphere. Visualize the Hierophant suspended in the center of the disc (this
image represents the Planetary Maharic Shield, the scalar wave grid com-
posed of dimension 10/11/12 frequency, with the Hierophant Key Code
positioned to activate the Planetary Shield.)</p></li>
<li><p>Exhale,  while pushing your breath outward into the Earth’s Maharic Shield,
imagining as you exhale that the force of the breath has made the Earth’s
Maharic Shield begin to spin.</p></li>
<li><p>Inhale,  using the inhale breath to draw Pale Silver Light from Earth’s spin-
ning Maharic Shield into the Hierophant positioned at the center of the
Planetary Shield.</p></li>
<li><p>Exhale,  using the exhale breath to push the Pale Silver Light throughout the
entire Hierophant making the Hierophant glow and pulsate with Pale Sil-
ver Light.</p></li>
<li><p>Inhale, imagine that the glowing Pale Silver Hierophant momentarily ﬂash-
es Crimson Red and returns to Pale Silver. Then use the inhale breath to
draw the Hierophant vertically up from its position at Earth’s core, to a po-
sition 12” below your feet (the position of your dormant personal Maharic
Shield scalar-wave grid). As you inhale the Hierophant upward from
Earth’s core, imagine that it trails a thick cord of Pale Silver Light behind
it. Qne end of the Silver Cord remains attached to Earth’s core, the other
attached to the Hierophant (the Cord represents an “Energy Feed Line”<br />

through which you will draw energy up from the Earth’s Maharic Shield
into your personal Maharic Shield)
9.   Exhale,  with your attention on the Hierophant positioned 12” below your
feet and use the exhale breath to push a burst of Pale Silver Light outward
on a horizontal plane from the Hierophant. Imagine that a Disc-shaped,
Crystalline Platform of Pale Silver Light about 4’ in diameter, extends on
a horizontal plane 12” beneath your feet around the Hierophant at its cen-
ter. (This image represents your personal Maharic Shield.)
10. Inhale,  while using the inhale breath to draw more Pale Silver Light up
through the Pale Silver Cord from Earth’s Core, into the Hierophant at
the center of your personal Maharic Shield.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="11">
<li><p>Exhale,  using the exhale breath to push the Pale Silver Light from the Hi-
erophant, out into your Maharic Shield. Imagine that your Maharic
Shield now pulsates, as it fills with the Pale Silver Light from Earth’s Core.</p></li>
<li><p>Inhale,  again drawing more Pale Silver Light up from Earth’s Core through
the Pale Silver Cord into the Hierophant, and imagine the Pale Silver
Cord expanding to four feet in width, forming a Pillar of Silver Light run-
ning up from Earth’s Core directly into your four-foot-diameter Maharic
Shield.</p></li>
<li><p>Exhale,  again using the exhale breath to push Pale Silver Light from the
Hierophant outward into your Maharic Shield, while imagining that your
Maharic Shield “takes on a life of its own,” the disc suddenly “folding
upward ” with a “ popping ” sensation, to form a 4’ diameter pillar of Pale
Silver Light all around and running through your body.2</p></li>
<li><p>Inhale,  imagining that the inhale breath draws the Pale Silver Light from
the Pillar encasing the body into every body cell. Sense the tingling feel-
ing as the Pale Silver Light moves through the physical body.</p></li>
<li><p>Exhale, imagining that you can feel the energy of the Pale Silver Light ex-
panding into every cell of the body and then outward around the body
into the Bio-field.</p></li>
<li><p>Breathe naturally for a minute or two, as the feeling of the Pale Silver Light
moves through you, while sensing the energy presence of the Maharic Seal
Pale Silver Pillar 4’ around your body. The more time you spend breathing
and sensing the energies, the more dimension 10/11/12 frequency you are
drawing into your Pillar, which will increase the length of time the Maha-
ric Seal Pillar will remain in your Bio-field.</p></li>
<li><p>Return your attention to the Hierophant still positioned 12” below your
feet.</p></li>
<li><p>Inhale , using the inhale breath to draw the Hierophant up through your
Central Vertical Body Current, then out the top of your head (the 7th
“Crown” Chakra), to a point about 36” above the head (the 14th Chakra).</p></li>

</li>
<li><p>Exhale for cefully , using the exhale breath to rapidly expand the Hi-
erophant outward on a horizontal plane at the 14th Chakra, until the Hi-
erophant suddenly “disappears” from view, with a mild “popping”
sensation.</p></li>
<li><p>Breathe normally, while visualizing for a moment a brilliant 4’ Pale Silver
Pillar of Light extending from the Earth’s Core upward, fully encasing
your body and extending far above the head, into Earth’s atmosphere and
to a single Star of Pale Blue Light far off in deep space. Your Maharic
Shield is now temporarily activated, and your Maharic Seal Pillar is tem-
porarily manifest within your Bio-Field. The Maharic Seal will remain in
your Bio-field anywhere from 20 minutes to 1 hour at first. The more this
exercise is practiced, the longer the Pillar will remain.</p></li>
<li><p>For quick reinforcement of the Maharic Seal, once the full process has
been run within 24 hours: Simply imagine a spark of Pale Silver Light at
the Pineal Gland, exhale it rapidly down to Earth’s Core and imagine the
Earth’s Maharic Shield spinning. Call to mind the Pale Silver Cord and
inhale the 4’ diameter Cord all the way up around you, forming the Pillar,
attaching it “out in deep space” to the Star of Pale Blue Light.
• The Short Version of this technique provides a “manually created” tempo-
rary Maharic Seal in your Bio-Field, and requires manual resetting every
24 hours, with frequent reinforcement during the day. Using and practic-
ing the full version of this technique, as described in the Kathara Bio-Spir-
itual Healing SystemTM Level-l  Maharic Recoding Process TM, will
progressively program the Cellular Memory of the body to hold the Ma-
haric Seal for prolonged periods of time. With consistent practice of the
full technique, over an extended period of time, the Maharic Seal will
function automatically as a permanent fixture within your B io-field.
• In the meantime, the Short Version of this technique, coupled with rein-
forcement throughout the day, will provide Bio-field protection and gen-
tle, regenerative Core Template realignmen t for all aspects of the
physical and Subtle-Energy-Body- systems. It is recommended to use at
least this Short Version of the Maharic Seal technique prior to ANY en-
ergy work, “channeling,” or Astral and Dream Projection. It will not only
provide protection from disharmonic energies; it will also amplify the re-
sults you desire to gain from these activities.

       FIELD TECHNIQUE 3: THE MAHARIC QUICK SEAL
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Work with a 24 pointed, 3 Dimensional Star (Hierophant) and be aware
that you will be working with beings known as the Breneau Rishi.</p></li>
<li><p>Begin by slowing your breathing, as you imagine or visualize a 24 point, 3-
Dimensional, Hierophant at the Pineal Gland in the center of your brain.
Visualize the Hierophant surrounded by a Pale Blue Sphere of Light.
(The Blue Sphere serves as a buffer for your readiness to accept the frequencies
associated with using the 24 pointed Star; the Blue Sphere holds the en-
ergy for you until your body can handle the energy. If you can handle it,
the energy will simply pass through the blue sphere).</p></li>
<li><p>Inhale,  as if you are going to grab the Blue Sphere containing the 24 point
star located at the Pineal, and on the Exhale move the 24 point star/ Blue
Sphere, all the way down to Earth’s Core. Try to hear a sound tone as the
Hierophant/ Sphere hits the Planetary Shields.</p></li>
<li><p>Inhale  and draw the Hierophant/ sphere up to your Personal Maharic Shield
12” below your feet…and Exhale  while watching the Pale Silver-Blue
sphere expand out to a large sphere…and watch as your Maharic Shield
pops out as a disc, about 4’ in diameter, Pale Silver with a light coating of
Pale Blue.</p></li>
<li><p>Bring your attention to the center of your Maharic Shield 12” below your
feet…and Inhale the 24 point Star (only) up into the Heart Chakra. Ex-
hale , expanding the frequencies of the 24 point Star into the Heart
Chakra.</p></li>
<li><p>Inhale  to grab the 24 point Star, and exhale , pushing the Star up into the
14th Chakra 36” above the head. Imagine that the 24 point Star is spin-
ning in a clockwise direction in the 14th Chakra. As you do this, try to
feel/sense the energy around you, just a few inches out from your body.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, put your attention into your Maharic Shield 12” below your feet, take
a couple of relaxing breaths and inhale deeply pulling the Pale Silver and
Blue energy up, as if you are pulling on your Maharic Seal to latch it on to
your 14th Chakra. Try and feel the sensations just a few inches from your
body now-feel the difference if you can. This procedure gives you a Quick
Seal.</p></li>
<li><p>Now envision the cord of Pale Silver Maharic Light that would normally
come up with your Shield and focus on the Earth’s Core. Begin drawing
energy all the way up the 4” diameter cord and into the body.  Inhale  the
energy up into the Heart Center, and expand it there. Begin to form a Pale
Silver ball of Maharic frequency.
On each exhale  send your energy down to the Earth’s Core to bring up another
load of Maharic frequency, up from the Planetary Shields, expand it into
the Heart center and repeat several times. Notice that the Cord grows
larger as you do this, expanding from approximately 4” to 6 to 8” diameter,
until finally it feels like a skin around (as well as wit hin) your body…as
you load your Astral field with Maharic Frequency.<br />

4. Three breaths : Take three final breaths, and with each one, inhale and visu
alize a stream of Pale Silver energy coming up through the feet from
earth’s core and simultaneously down from the Sun through the top of the
head…the two streams of energy meeting to form one thick Silver stream
at the Heart Chakra. Exhale  Maharic frequency into the group center
point.
After the third energizing breath, simply breathe normally, as each exhale
moves energy into the group center point. Stand with the group for a
few moments and visualize the Um Shaddai Ur Pillar of Light emanat
ing from the Sun, through the group Pillar and group Maharic
Shield…and into the Earth core Maharic Shield</p>
