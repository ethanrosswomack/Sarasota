   It is important to realize that the “Seven Seals and Four Horsemen”
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>story of Jehovian Biblical Revelations is a colorfully encoded depiction of
tangible events  of science, technology , the mechanics of planetary physics
and the intentions of the Fallen Angelic visitors, as these elements would
emerge within the 2000-2017 Stellar Activation Cycle (SAC). Presently the
hidden realities of the natural 12 Planetary Star Crystal Seals  and unnatural
Seven Jehovian Seals  (see page 419) have a tremendous bearing upon what
humanity will experience between now and 2008.<br />
The 12 natural Star Crystal Seals in Earth’ s Planetary Shields
sequentially and automatically release or “open” in response to the
progressive Stellar Wave Infusions (frequency infusions) generated by the
opening of Earth’s 12 Primary Star Gates. Release of the natural Seals alone
can cause cataclysmic Earth Changes during a SAC, if the Planetary Shields
are not functioning properly. Due to the effects of the Nibiruian Diodic
Crystal Grid (NDC-Grid) technology that has created progressive distortion
within Earth’s Planetary Shields since 25,500 BC,  Earth’ s core scalar-wave
template has suffered extensive damage.  Emerald Covenant Guardian
Nations were faced with a huge challenge in keeping Earth’s Planetary
Shields stabilized  during the 2000-2017 SAC, even before the damage to
Earth’s grids was profoundly increased through the progression of Fallen
Angelic/Illuminati One World Order (OWO) agendas since 1930.<br />
V arious Emerald Covenant nations would have liked to have initiated
direct, physical, public contact with the inhabitants of Earth by 1930, so that
this pending planetary crisis could have been handled cooperatively and
directly from surface Earth locations. If it were not for the fact that Human
and Illuminati governments chose to honor the 1930s Zeta Treaties rather
than to accept the Guardians’ offer of Emerald Covenant entry, first contact
with Guardian nations and direct repair of Earth’s Planetary Shields would
have already taken place.<br />
As circumstances have dictated since 1930, and even since 9558 BC,
Emerald Covenant nations could not directly intervene via mass physical
contact. If Guardians had attempted mass physical contact, various Fallen

</div>
<p>Angelic legions would have immediately brought this covert intergalactic/
interdimensional war “out into the open,” and human civilizations would
have been decimated by overt Fallen Angelic/Intruder ET warfare waged on
Earth’s territories.<br />
If the Illuminati and Human races within the Interior W orld
Government had chosen Emerald Covenant rather than Zeta Treaties in the
1930s, Guardian races could have worked with them to peacefully seal Earth’s
Star Gate and portal system—the Falcon Wormhole (see page 367)—and to
disengage the NDC-Grid. This would have prevented further Fallen Angelic
infiltration and Earth’s Planetary Shields could have been sufficiently
repaired in time for the 2000-2017 SAC. Covert World Management Team
cooperation with the Guardians’ world-freedom agenda in the l930s would
have permitted members of the Sirius-B Maharaji races to be “smuggled” in
to Earth territories without engaging the suspicions and retaliation of Fallen
Angelic legions. Earth’s Templar would have been reclaimed from Fallen
Angelic control and Humanity would have been restored to its rightful place
as Guardians of Earth’s Templar. “ Would’a-Could’a-Should’a ” Hindsight is
the greatest foresight . Unfortunately, Illuminati and Human members of the
covert Interior Government did not accept the 1930 opportunity for a
peaceful resolution and, equally as unfortunate, the Anunnaki races chose to
join the United Intruder Resistance (UIR) OWO dominion campaign on
September 12, 2000. And here we all sit in 2001 as the long-anticipated Final
Conﬂict drama begins the emergence into physical manifestation. The
greatest danger  to Earth populations at this time is posed by the ‘’ Seven
Jehovian Seals ‘’ and the fact that the natural 12-Star Crystal Seals  in
Earth’s Planetary Shields have now begun to open  into severely damaged
Planetary Shields. The damage to Earth’s grids has already reached crisis
proportions, and the UIR intends to amplify this condition beyond repair by
2003.<br />
Even in SACs that proceed smoothly , each time a natural Planetary
Star Crystal Seal activates, the frequencies it releases into Earth’s
Planetary Shields progressively exerts nucleic stress  within the
molecules of Earth’s tectonic plates. In areas of the planet where
Planetary Shield distortions  exist, the molecular structure of Earth’ s
plates experiences weakened resistance and less flexibility from this
nucleic stress. The climatic/weather patterns  in such areas become less
stable,  and the tectonic plates become vulnerable to seismic activity .
Each of the natural 12 Planetary Seals releases a progressively higher-
dimensional frequency spectrum  into Earth’ s Shields, thus exerting a
progressively increasing amount of nucleic stress within Earth’s tectonic
plates, which is difficult enough to contend with in areas of Planetary
Shields distortions without adding the unnatural “Seven Jehovian
Seals ” to the mess, which spells ‘’ pending crisis ‘’—a crisis the Emerald
Covenant nations are presently trying desperately to avoid via remote
frequency transmission into Earth’s Planetary Shields. Without assistance
from Human and Indigo Children in “anchoring” these frequencies into
Earth’s Shields via Rainbow Roundtables (RRTs)  and Masters Planetary<br />
Merkaba Mechanics,  Guardian efforts to prevent this crisis would fail.<br />

<p>The unnatural Seven Jehovian Seals are a despicable atrocity of
technological ‘’achievement .’’
Since 10,500 BC, the implanted crystalline rods of the Jehovian Seals
have lain dormant in Earth’s crust and mantle like hidden “missiles,”
designed to progressively rip Earth’s Planetary Shields apart as Earth’s 12
natural Seals proceed through their opening cycle during the 2000-2017
SAC. Each Jehovian Seal “opens”  and begins activating its frequencies
in Earth’s Templar when its corresponding Organic Seal enters its
activation cycle in response to Earth’s particle pulsation (vibration/
oscillation) rhythm. The chaotically arranged, unnatural frequencies of
the Jehovian Seal (the “rider” or “Horseman”) bond to the natural
frequencies transmitted by the Organic Star Crystal Seal (the “Horse”).
The “rider” frequency silently moves with the natural frequency current
into the Axiatonal and Ley Line (ALL) system  corresponding to the
Organic Seal, progressively reversing  the natural Angular-Rotation-of
Particle-Spin ( ARPS , the particle spin axis) within the frequencies of
electromagnetic energy moving through the ALLs. As the currents of
frequency moving through the ALL system progressively reverse to the
unnatural ARPS of the Phantom Matrix , the corresponding portions of
Earth’s Planetary Shields are drawn into electromagnetic bonding with
the D-7 Phantom Arcturus Planetary Shields. The first three Jehovian
Seals reverse the ARPS on the three ALL networks to which they
correspond. The related areas of Earth’s Planetary Shields do not begin
ripping apart to bond with the Phantom Matrix until the opening of the
Fourth Jehovian Seal—the ‘’Pale Horseman .’’
Once a SAC has commenced, as the current SAC did on January 1,
2000,  Guardian nations cannot stop or prevent the natural Organic Seal, or
corresponding unnatural Jehovian Seven-Seal release sequences from
occurring. Manual interruption of these processes would cause absolute, rapid
pole shift and cataclysmic Earth Changes,  which Guardian nations can only
prevent by striving to balance the frequencies of the Organic Seals , while
clearing and realigning the chaotic frequencies  of the Jehovian Seals to a
natural “12-Code-Pulse .” The Organic and Jehovian Seal counterpart must
activate before 12-Code realignment can be achieved. Manual resetting of
the natural 12-Code-Pulse “Divine D-12 Pre-matter Blueprint” in Earth’s
ALL system is accomplished through running D-12 frequency ¹ into Earth’ s
Planetary Shields via RRTs conducted at specific times and locations.<br />
When an Organic Seal releases, it takes anywhere from three to 12
months for its frequencies to spread through, and reach critical mass within,
the corresponding ALL network. As the Jehovian Seals’ chaotic frequencies
“ride on” the Organic Seal current, the effects of Jehovian Seal “opening”
also emerge and reach critical mass between three and 12 months  after the
Jehovian Seal has released. If the Jehovian Seals release and are not realigned
to a 12-Code-Pulse before reaching critical mass, climatic and/or tectonic
disturbances  will erupt within the geographical regions corresponding to the
Jehovian Seal’s placement. just as is the case with Earth’s 12 Organic Star

<p>Crystal Seals, each Seal in the Jehovian sequence progression is more
powerful than the one before; the Jehovian Seals 1, 2 and 3 create a lesser
degree of climatic/tectonic disturbance than Jehovian Seals 4 through 7 .
Planetary chaos begins  with release of Jehovian Seal-4 . if the frequencies of
Seal-4 and those before it are not manually realigned to a natural 12-Code-
Pulse as they run through Earth’s Templar.<br />
Organic Star Crystal Seals 1 and 2 , and their corresponding unnatural
Jehovian Seals-1 and -2,2 activated in late May 2001 —the planetary effects
of Jehovian Seal-1 and -2 release will begin manifesting between August
2001 and May 2002 . The chaotic frequencies of Jehovian Seals 1 and 2 had
been converted to a  natural 12-Code-Pulse realignment  via RRT s
conducted in Kauai, Hawaii,  when the Seals released in May 2001. Organic
Seal-3 and its unnatural Jehovian Seal-3  counterpart3 activated in late July
2001—its chaotic frequencies had been converted  to a natural 12-Code-
Pulse via RRTs conducted in England  when the Seal released in July 2001.
Between August 15 and September 3, 2001 , the UIR fully activated the
Montauk-Phi-Ex-Falcon wormhole Port Interface Atlantian Pylon
Implant Network (APIN) system , launching the sub-space sonic-scalar
amplification pulse  that passed through the Star Gate-2 Gru-AL Point in
Sarasota, FL, on the evening of September 3, 2001, on its way to the
Bermuda Base (see page 408). On the evening of September 3, 2001, Organic
Star Crystal Seal-4  (which does not have a Jehovian Seal companion)
activated as we gathered at Sarasota Beach following our Labor Day
workshops to conduct an RRT to assist the GA in balancing the Organic
Seal-4 frequencies as they emerged. Just prior to our initiation of the RRT ,
the sonic amplification pulse,4 transmitted from “Cue Site-4” Central
Mexico via the Nibiruian Crystal Temple Network at Chihuahua, Mexico,
rumbled through the Gru-AL Point off the coast of Sarasota Beach.</p>

<p>As Organic Seal-4 began to open, the UlRs contrived sonic pulse,
carrying a “ Phantom Pulse ” with reversed ARPS , ran through the Gru-AL
and through the Bio-energetic Fields of the RRT group.5 When the sonic
pulse intercepted the natural current emerging from Organic Seal-4, it
reversed the Seal-4 current to the Phantom Pulse ARPS . Reversal of the
stronger Organic Seal-4 current, instantly began to reactivate the reverse-
ARPS frequencies of Jehovian Seals 1, 2 and 3 that we had successfully
helped to realign to the 12-Code-Pulse during the May and July 2001 RRTs.

                           chaotic sonic pulse was powerful; we are still recovering from some of the physical
                                   side effects we incurred from absorbing and transmuting these frequencies. Numerous
                                                  others within the group also reported the experience of “emotional body p urging&quot; follow-

                    Conclusion— Earth Changes Potential
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Despite the terribly disruptive energies of the Psychotronic sonic pulse that
we experienced on the beach the night of September 3, the group managed
to pull itself together and run the RRT as planned. The  RRT was successful;
through this group effort the GA was able to anchor a sufficient amount of D-
12 and higher frequency to bring the Organic Seal-4 current back into its
natural ARPS.<br />
By September 10, the September 3 RRT frequencies reached critical mass
in the Planetary Shields, returning the primary Organic Seal-4 frequencies
back to their natural 12-Code—Pulse. Jehovian Seals 1, 2 and 3  have, as of
this writing, partially reverted back to the 12-Code-Pulse clearing , but still
require some additional work before reaching their original state of 12-Code-
Pulse conversion. This means that at least mild climatic disturbance effects
from Jehovian Seals 1-3 are likely to occur between now and July 2002 . Our
groups will be working with the Emerald Covenant nations, running RRTs on
several occasions between October and November 2001 , to clear the
remaining disruptive frequencies now running through Earth’s grids from
Jehovian Seals 1-3.<br />
Full clearing of the Jehovian Seals 1-2-3 frequencies must be
accomplished before the coming activation  of Organic Seal-8, with its
Jehovian Seal-4  companion,6 if ampli fied climatic/tectonic disturbances are
to be averted. Organic Seal-8/Jehovian Seal-4 will activate in early January
2002.7 Much to UIR irritation, We’re still standin’,  with even greater
strength of spirit and personal resolve than before, despite their attempts at
Psychotronic antagonism of Emerald Covenant groups. It became quite
apparent, in reviewing the events of the evening of September 3, that the
Eieyani were quite serious when they had earlier that day explained that the
UIR was now taking aggressive steps  to rapidly advance their OWO agenda.
Just how aggressive these steps would be did not become apparent until the
morning of September 11, 2001.<br />
When Jehovian Seals release, their frequencies can create disruptions for up to a
1000-2000 mile perimeter s urrounding the Seal’s placement, while the greatest degree
of climatic or tectonic disruption occurs in the location of the Seal and within 100-200
miles  of its epicenter. The  Seven Jehovian Seals  are located at different horizontal Ley Line/
Latitude coordinates along the common vertical Axiatonal Line-7 at 70°
W Longitude, which runs down the eastern Atlantic Ocean.  (See Star
Gates and Seals Map Appendix-3).<br />
Jehovian Seal-1,  the least powerful, is located NE of Quebec, Canada
at 70° W Longitude/47.08° N Latitude . Due to the May 2001 Jehovian
Seal-1 release, this region is likely to experience climatic disturbances or
intensification of natural weather patterns  between November 2001
and May 2002,  with January-February 2002 being the most vulnerable
periods.<br />
Jehovian Seal-2,  also released in May 2001, is located where the
borders of Peru, Chile and Bolivia meet, at 70° W Longitude/18.1° S

<p>Latitude; due to Jehovian Seal-2 release, this area is vulnerable to seismic
activity,  especially between December 2001 and March 2002 .
Jehovian Seal-3 , released in July 2001, is located at 70° W
Longitude/41.78° N Latitude,  Cape Cod, MA. This area, and regions of
the US east coast , are vulnerable to aggravated storm activity,
particularly between December 2001 and June 2002 , due to Jehovian
Seal-3 release. Jehovian Seal-4 , the “Pale Horse with the rider named
Death,” will release in early January 2002,  as will Jehovian Seal-5.<br />
Jehovian Seal-4 , the first of the more powerful Jehovian Seals, is
located east of Nassau Bahamas, at 70° W Longitude/24.92° N Latitude .
If Jehovian Seals 1-4 are not successfully converted to a 12-Code-Pulse
alignment within four months of the Seal’s January 2002 opening, cycles
of progressively more severe tropical storm and hurricane activity
(category 3-5) will emerge in the Atlantic Ocean. The Bahamas, Cuba ,
the east and west coasts of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico border lands
are primary regions to be affected by release of Jehovian Seal-4. Release of
Jehovian Seal-4 marks the beginning of the Jehovian Anunnaki and
Annu-Elohim opening of the “Cracks in the Wall in Time,” (see
page 386) through which geographical regions holding Dove APIN
system implants  will begin opening to the Phantom Matrix.<br />
Jehovian Seal-5,  which activates two days following the opening of
Jehovian Seal-4 in January 2002, is located near Copiapo, Chile, at 70° W
Longitude/26.95° S Latitude . If Jehovian Seal-5 is not cleared to 12-Code-
Pulse realignment within four months of its January 2002 opening, this
region is vulnerable to several waves of seismic activity with progressively
increasing magnitude.<br />
Jehovian Seal-6,  due to release in August or September 2002,  is located
at 70° W Longitude/ 10.36° N Latitude Venezuela . If we refer to the
Jehovian book of Revelations, the ‘’Sixth Seal” opening is foretold to bring
on a ‘’Great Earthquake’’…. ‘’and every mountain and island was moved from
its place’’…. Lets hope the Guardian’s 12-Code-Pulse realignments proceed
very well between now and then!
Jehovian Seal-7  is located at 70° W Longitude/ 33.13° N Latitude , off
the coast of Charleston, SC. If this Jehovian Seal is not realigned to a 12-
Code-Pulse, massive ﬂooding and category 5+ hurricane activity would
plague the eastern US seaboard, and most of Florida would rapidly become
an underwater Atlantian Theme Park . So much for ‘’merciful Jehovian
Gods’’!<br />
They have had all of this planned for us since 10,500 BC, but the ‘’ Seven
Seals’ ‘ were only the intended beginning ; after the Seals come the “Seven
Angels and Seven T rumpets ‘’ (see page 414). These bring on ‘’hail and fire
mixed with blood,’’ ‘’a blazing mountain being thrown into the sea turning
the sea to blood,’’ the fall of Nibiruian Battlestar Wormwood on the Rivers of
the Earth, followed by plagues, Beasts from the Pit and finally the intended<br />
grand Jehovian Anunnaki invasion. These guys are real humanitarians!<br />
The Indigo Children are the return of the Emerald Covenant Maji Grail

<p>Templar Mechanics, we can peacefully prevent ful fillment of the “Final
Conﬂict” drama, finally freeing Earth from over 12,000 years of Fallen
Angelic/Illuminati dominion. I hope we begin to wake up soon because the
“movie” has already started without us.<br />
There are many more issues we need to understand in order to help
ourselves, and our planet through these most important of times. If one has
courage, and wants to make a difference in how this messy “Final Conﬂict”
drama unfolds, if one cares to assist the Guardian nations in preventing
further advancement of the UIR Fallen Angelic invasion of Earth , the place
to begin is at home . Awakening the Inner Christos, your own personal, God-
given D-12 Avatar identity level, which has been long cruci fied upon the
cross of false Fallen Angelic indoctrination and DNA manipulation, waits
sleeping within each of us. The Maharic Shield Bio-Regenesis Techniques
(see page 496) begin the process of this Inner Awakening . If you are moved
to assist the Emerald Covenant Founders nations in the protection and
restoration of this planet, the Masters Templar Coursebook ,
provides instruction on the Sacred Arts/Sciences of
running the Signet (Star Gate) Rainbow Roundtables (RRTs). Through our
participation in ‘’running of the Rounds’’ the Founders’ ancient ‘’ Four Faces
of Man ‘’ LPIN  and the “ Great White Lion ” and ‘’ Golden Eagle ‘’ APIN
grid-micro-chip implant systems can be reawakened to protect Earth from the
Fallen Angelic APIN systems that are now activating in Earth’s Planetary
Shields.<br />
This ‘’Final Battle of the Angels” cannot be won through violent wars,
but victory can be achieved for all peace-loving nations through the
peaceful, Christiac Technologies of Masters Biotronic, Merkaba and
Planetary Templar Mechanics . The choice is ours, and in truth, time is
running out , as the UIR now aggressively advances its Illuminati OWO
dominion agenda in the 3-D arena. How many more atrocities like WW2
and the 9/11/2001 Terrorist Disaster, precursor to WW3, do we need to
see before  we ‘’get the message? ‘’
This book is by no means the end of the seemingly ‘’Never-Ending
Vo y a g e r s  S t o r y ‘ ‘ - i t  i s  o n l y  t h e  b e g i n n i n g .  B u t  i t  i s  a  m o s t  a p p r o p r i a t e ,  a s  w e l l
as deeply sincere beginning, particularly if one desires to awaken from the
perhaps blissful, but never-the-less amnesiac sleep of Fallen Angelic
manipulation. Each of us has the potential to emerge wide-eyed with wonder
into the new dawn of Human freedom as our Inner Light awakens, to lead our
living spirits Upward,….Godward,….Home.<br />
With light, love and heartfelt condolences to all who have suffered from
the dreadful events of the 9/11/2001 WTC/Pentagon Terrorist Attack ….</p>
