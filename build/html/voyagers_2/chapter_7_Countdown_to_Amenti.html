 Several events have occurred during the last 98 years of your evolution

<p>that could have drastically altered the course of your history. One such event
took place in the early 1900, which was repeated again in 1982. During
both of these periods large asteroid masses came into alignment with Earth’s
orbit, and if they had not been destroyed or diverted in deep space by interdi-
mensional Guardian ﬂeets, before they entered your solar system, conditions
supportive of life on Earth would have been destroyed. Because you were so
close to the coming 2017 AD morphogenetic wave, and the potentials of
ascension it holds, numerous Guardian races petitioned the Azurite Council,
Elohim and Ra Confederacy on your behalf, to allow non-direct intervention
in Earth’s affairs. Permission was granted. On the first occasion in 1906, the
asteroid was destroyed, and only portions of its debris bombarded Earth’s sur-
face. On the second occasion, in 1982, the asteroid was broken into two
pieces and its path was diverted using electromagnetic, Keylontic technolo-
gies. The asteroids are the least of the problems you have encountered within
your current century.<br />
RECENT HISTORY<br />
The Original Zeta Agenda and the Zeta Seal<br />
1926 AD -6643 AD<br />
In 1926 time traveling members of the Zeta/Zephelium races, originally
from the planet Apaxein-Lau began interacting with private factions within
several Earth governments. The Zeta agenda is discussed in earlier chapters.
In recent years the Zetas conducted several projects that had a highly detri-
mental effect upon the vibration rate of Earth’s grid and which damaged
Earth’s bio-energetic fields. If  the Sirian Council had not intervened, Earth’ s pop-
ulations would have been decimated between 1972 and 1974, and Earth would
have experienced a pole shift during the mid-1980s.  The Zetas and their Dracos
(Drakon-human hybrid) and Rutilia (Zeta-Dracos hybrid) accomplices desire

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>to take over Earth’s territory. The Dracos, being created as a hybrid race of
Drakonian and human genetic structure about one million years ago on
Earth, feel dominion of Earth is their birthright, as Earth is their planet of ori-
gin. The Dracos are Earthlings who were banned from their home planet
Earth, and exiled to the Orion star system one million years ago. The Zeta/
Zephelium races were involved with Atlantean and Atlanian Earth cultures,
and for a time colonized Mars. Both groups share a common interest in pos-
sessing Earth to facilitate the continuation of their races’ evolution.<br />
The Zetas’  original plan was born out of their need to retain control of
a future human society. In the future of Earth, between 4230 AD and 6443
AD, the Zeta/Dracos alliance has successfully overtaken the human world
culture in that time period. This time period takes place within the First
ascension cycle time continuum of  Tara’s 26,556-year Harmonic Time cycle,
the natural path of evolution into which Earth would next evolve to become
Tara, following completion of its present cycle in 4230 AD. The Sixth Root
Race Muvarians and descendants of the present human races live there now
in a Zeta-ruled society, controlled by Frequency Fence and Holographic
Insert technology. These events are taking place now, in that future time-space
coordinate. In order for the Zetas to retain control over that society, they have trav-
eled backward through time to Earth’ s present.  Humanity’s upcoming opportu-
nity for accelerated evolution between 2012-2017 AD poses a direct threat
to the Zetas’ ability to retain control of that society. If 8% of present day
humans are able to successfully take this evolutionary leap, the humans of
4230 AD-6443 AD will be set free from the Zeta Collective Mind Frequency
Fence through which they are presently controlled in their space-time coor-
dinate. The Zetas do not want this to occur.<br />
The Zetas’  original Earth agenda involved first creating Zeta-human
hybrid strains that could comfortably thrive on Earth. In the second phase of
their plan, they intended to make sure that the grids of Earth and Tara did
not merge during the 2012-2017 half-cycle point. By stopping this event,
Earth would remain trapped in HU-1 for another 26,556-year cycle, and the
human populations could not accelerate their evolution and activate their
fifth DNA strand. If the Zetas could keep Earth in the HU-1 time band and
gain control of the planet here, they would insure the continuation of their
future stronghold on D-4 Tara-Earth. If Earth successfully merged with Tara
between 2012-2017, and the morphogenetic wave allowed fifth-dimensional
frequency to move through Earth’s grid, the Frequency Fence through which
the D-4 Zeta controlled their human populations would be released. If ascen-
sion of Earth humans could be stopped by 2012, the Zetas could retain con-
trol of their D-4 holding. If humans began ascension to the D-4 time cycles
of Tara, their assembled fifth-strand DNA imprint would correct the D-4
DNA mutation the Zetas used to keep their humans under the Frequency
Fence. Humans in the D-4 time cycle would be set free if 8% of the D-3

<p>humans of Earth activated their fifth DNA strand. These present-day humans
would correct, within the race morphogenetic field of the Sphere of Amenti,
the Zeta-created D-4/fourth-DNA strand distortion that keeps the future
humans controlled. By ascending through Amenti, humans with activated
fifth DNA strands would realign the morphogenetic field of the future races,
reversing the genetic mutation the Zetas use to control the future humans.<br />
In this future period, Muvarians and descendants of present human
races are kept from ascension and evolution to higher consciousness and
immortality by a seal the Zetas placed within their fourth DNA strand. The
Zeta Seal  stopped the fifth DNA strand from plugging into the lower strands,
so these future soul essences are trapped within Tara’s First time cycle in the
D-4 astral planes. As long as the future races carry this fourth strand DNA
distortion, humans on Earth will also carry this distortion of the fourth DNA
strand, and they will be unable to evolve past that D-4 time cycle. The Zetas
infiltrated the D-4 future time continuum about 400 years ago in Earth time,
and successfully implemented the Zeta Seal Frequency Fence there about 250
years ago. The Zeta Seal and Frequency Fence have thus manifested within
the present-day human genetic pool and within Earth’s morphogenetic field,
for the past 250 years, since about 1748 AD. All human souls incarnating on
Earth since 1748 AD have the Zeta-Seal distortion within their fourth DNA
strand. As your life span is presently only about 75-100 years long, this
implies that all people on your planet at this time carry the Zeta Seal genetic muta-
tion.<br />
The second base tone and second and third overtones of the fourth DNA
strand were unable to manifest in the operational DNA, because these fre-
quency patterns were taken out of the morphogenetic field of Tara-Earth in
that future time period, in order to create the Frequency Fence. This block-
age within the future Earth’s morphogenetic field also caused blockage of
these frequencies in your Earth morphogenetic field in 1748, a distortion
which then manifested within the human gene code as souls from Amenti
passed through the Earth’s morphogenetic field to birth on Earth. This mor-
phogenetic distortion of Earth, created by Zeta manipulation in the future,
has created a hidden Zeta Frequency Fence  on Earth since 1748.<br />
The fourth DNA  strand mutation has created an unnatural blockage
between the higher self aspect of identity (the portion of personal identity
focused in the UHF bands of D-3) and the D-4 astral awareness. This block-
age manifests as greater fragmentation within the dream state, difficulty in
orchestrating and remembering astral/“out-of-body” travel, an unnatural
blockage within the fourth chakra, repression of the natural intuitive senses
and an inability to fully assemble the fourth DNA strand. The Zeta Fre-
quency Fence on Earth made it easy for the Zetas to directly in ﬂuence human
behavior, as it connected the human DNA directly into the Zeta Collective
Mind complex that controlled the populations in the future. Since 1748,

<p>levels, by the Brainwashing Program that is broadcast by the Zeta Collective
Mind Complex, from this future time period. This influence has played a
major role in the development of human cultures since that time.<br />
If these circumstances had been left to evolve unabated, the entire
human race would now be under the mental control of the Zeta Collective
Mind, and Earth’s vibration would have dropped too low to hold the Sphere
of Amenti for the 2017 half-point. The Zetas would not have had to do any-
thing to stop the grids of Tara and Earth from merging, as this would have
been a natural consequence of the effects of their Frequency Fence in the
future. In 1902 Guardian groups intervened and began “poking holes” in
Earth’s Zeta Frequency Fence by orchestrating astral-body realignments from
D-4, on various portions of the human population. The astral-body realign-
ments repaired the fourth DNA strand and added the fifth strand imprint to
these groups of humans, progressively bringing the corrected fourth strand
imprint back into the Earth’s morphogenetic field. When at least 8% of
Earth’s populations carried the corrected imprint, the Earth’s morphogenetic
field would realign and the morphogenetic field of Tara-Earth in the future
would follow suit and begin realigning. Through this astral involvement
with humans, the Guardians were able to begin dismantling the Frequency
Fence on Earth and on Tara-Earth. In 1986, Earth populations carrying the
re-aligned fourth DNA imprint peaked at 8%, and the Zetas’ Frequency
Fence on Earth deteriorated. The Tara-Earth Frequency Fence of the future
also began to unravel, and the Zetas began losing control over their future
human populations.<br />
The Zetas began interacting directly with Earth’ s present cultures in
1926, in order to survey the effects of Guardian intervention on their Fre-
quency Fence, and to monitor the progression of the fourth-strand mutation
within the human DNA. They were aware of the upcoming half-point
ascension cycle and that their Frequency Fence would be collapsing at some
point before 20l2. The Zetas knew that they would have to reconstruct the
Frequency Fence and take action to prevent Earth’s grid from receiving its
scheduled infusion of D-5 through D-9 frequency. They decided they would
create Zeta-human hybrids, which possessed mutated fourth-strand genetic
codes, to repopulate the Earth following 2017. After the hybrids were cre-
ated, and their Frequency Fence on Earth was reconstructed, they planned to
eradicate all races carrying the realigned fourth and fifth DNA strand
imprint, by using Holographic Insert technology to vaporize the unwanted
specimens by passing them through UHF portals. In order to maintain con-
trol of their stronghold in the future, the Zetas returned to the past (Earth’s
recent past and present) to create the structures that would hold their control
of future populations in place. They began physical in filtration of Earth
between World Wars l and ll. Working with the Allied Governments in

<p>World War ll, they formed covert agreements that would allow them to con-
duct experimentation on the human populations in order to begin the cre-
ation of hybrids to replenish their declining race and through which they
could take over Earth after 2017. The covert human Majestic 12 (MJ-12)
group was formed within the Allied human governments at this time, to
secretly oversee treaties they formalized with the Zetas. The Zetas then
began the next phase of their plan, a scheme of which MJ-12 knew nothing.
During the late 1930s and early 1940s, the Zetas began their hybridiza-
tion program, then turned their attention toward reconstruction of the Fre-
quency Fence and stopping the grid merge of Earth and Tara scheduled for
2012-2017. The Zetas possess the knowledge and technology that would
allow them to misalign the electromagnetic fields of Earth and Tara, so the
planetary grids could not begin to merge in 2012. They understand the elec-
tromagnetic relationships between Earth’s planetary energetic fields and
those of the Sun. With this understanding, they devised a plan to shift the
electromagnetic fields of Earth and Tara by altering the electromagnetic fields
of Earth’s Sun. Before exploring the Zetas’ manipulation of the Sun, let us
review a brief lesson in the mechanics of multidimensional, electromagnetic
fields.
MERKABA FIELDS                                                                                  Merkaba Field Mechanics<br />
All planetary spheres possess sets of counter-rotating electromagnetic
fields, within and surrounding the planetary body. In the first-dimensional
frequency bands, Earth has a magnetic spiral of energy composed of the 12
base tone frequency patterns of D-1. This counter-clockwise rotating mag-
netic spiral pulls energy transmitted by the Sun into the D-1 portion of
Earth’s morphogenetic field, Earth’s D-1 Iron Core Crystal. Earth also has a
clockwise-rotating, electrical, D-l energy spiral composed of the 12 overtone
frequency patterns of D-1. The electrical spiral transmits energy from the D-1
portion of Earth’s morphogenetic field downward, where the energy is then
picked up by the D-1 magnetic spiral of the Sun. A planetary sphere has such
a set of counter-rotating electromagnetic spirals within each dimensional fre-
quency band. The two spirals form two pyramidal shaped energy constructs,
and the magnetic spiral is inverted within the upright electrical spiral. The
collective construction of the two energy fields is that of a Star tetrahedron ,
and this structure is referred to as a Merkaba Field.  Every planet, object and
person has such a Merkaba Field within each of the 15-dimensional bands. It
is the energy construct through which energetic substance emerges from and
returns to the morphogenetic field, the structure through which energy and
consciousness enter and leave manifestation.<br />

D-1 is the D-2 Merkaba Field, which is located within the Earth’s core at the
D-2 frequency level and serves to hold the morphogenetic imprint and parti-
cle base of Earth in place. Earth’s D-3 Merkaba Field extends about 444,000
miles out into space and serves to hold Earth’s atmosphere in place. (The
hole in Earth’s ozone layer represents a disruption within Earth’s D-3 Merk-
aba Field).<br />
The D-4 Merkaba Field of Earth exists as a minute crystal encased in ele-
mental gold, which is presently located within a black hole at the center of
Earth’s Sun at the D-4 frequency level. It serves to ground Tara’s morphoge-

cores of your solar system) into HU-2, and also connects the planets of your
solar system in HU-l to Tara’s D-5 core in HU-2.<br />
T ara-Earth’ s D-5 Merkaba Field surrounds the D-4 gold crystal at the
Sun’s core at the level of fifth-dimensional frequency, and thus your Sun and
solar system are encased within this fifth-dimensional Merkaba Field. The D-</p>
