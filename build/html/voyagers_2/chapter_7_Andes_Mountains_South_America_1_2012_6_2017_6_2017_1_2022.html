          <p>7       Andes Mountains, South America               1/2012  - 6/2017              6/2017  - 1/2022
As each vortex progressively opens and activates, the dimensional frequency
bands that correspond to the vortex number begin transmitting through Earth’s
morphogenetic field. This causes the Sphere of Amenti to begin transmitting its
morphogenetic imprint for that dimensional frequency band through Earth’s grid. The
frequency imprints for DNA strands 1 - 8, which are stored within the morphogenetic
field of the Sphere of Amenti (along with the imprints for strands 9-12), progressively
transmit through Earth’s grid, as the dimensional frequency bands that correspond to
each strand begin transmission . The frequency bands of D-8 Meta-galactic Core, which
accelerate activation of the 8th DNA strand, transmit through Earth’s grid when Earth’s planetary
core comes into a direct 3-day alignment with the cores of Tara, Gaia and the Meta-galactic
Core, as Earth aligns directly with the Holographic Beam. The imprints for DNA strands 9-12 do
not transmit through Earth’s grid; they are accessible only through the grid of Tara. Activation of
strands 1-8 on Earth allows for ascension to the Taran time cycles, from which the imprint for
strands 9-12 can be accessed.
The human bio-energetic field picks up the DNA imprint through its direct contact
with the bio-energetic fields of Earth’s grid, which provides humans with the opportunity
to add that imprint in its operational DNA construction. The process of activating the new
imprint takes place as the strand imprint is pulled from the bio-energetic field, into the
personal morphogenetic field, at which point the new imprint will begin manifestation
within the operational DNA strands . DNA strand mutations are purged from the race
morphogenetic imprint in the Sphere of Amenti and the strand imprint is realigned with the
12 strand DNA pattern by the successive births of the 6 Silent Ascension Avatars.
Transmission of the corrected DNA strand imprints through Earth’s grid allows a
reverse-mutation of various ascension-inhibiting human genetic distortions to take place .
Earth’s 7 Primary Vortices  open only during the two ascension cycles, at the beginning and
end of a 26,556-year Harmonic Universe Euiago time cycle, The energetic dynamics that Earth
now approaches, as it enters the ½ cycle point in its 2nd ascension cycle, are unprecedented
within the annals of recorded human history . The coming of these events has been symbolically
foretold through oral and written tradition for thousands of years.

<p>T = birth is scheduled for this date, but may occur any time earlier, most likely
following the birth of the previous avatar. Birth must occur no later than
scheduled date. Birth will remain as scheduled  unless circumstances warrant
change. ** = avatar 3 was not scheduled to birth until 2000 AD, but Elohim
arranged the birth 2 years early to open the 2nd seal on the Arc of the Covenant,
so the ascension schedule could remain on course. NOTE:  There will also be
144,000 + ‘’indigo Children “ born between 1999 - 2017  They will carry the 6
DNA strand Paradisian Race Imprint , that of the fully embodied HU-2 soul essence.
They represent  D-6 soul essence  and will birth via the frequencies of the D-6 Sirian
Spiral , which falls within the inter-dimensional lndigo light wave spectrum , thus
their name. Activation of the 6th DNA strand of a minimum of 144,000 individuals is
essential for Earth’s passage into the Bridge Zone. The D-6 souls will birth on Earth
to serve in ful filling this requirement. The 6 Silent Avatars and indigo Children are born
via Palaidorian Birthing Contracts  and Contract Bonds.

<p>Human Origins : Humanity began 560 million years ago, as an Immortal Race called
the Turaneusiam on planet Tara in Harmonic Universe-2 (HU-2). The Turaneusiam race
had a 12 strand DNA morphogenetic imprint that allowed for embodiment of the 12 dimensional
frequency bands of an HU-4 avatar identity. Humans were created as a planetary guardian race
of God-like beings.
Lost Souls of Tara:  Through a Turaneusiam created cataclysm on HU-2 Tara 550 million
years ago part of Tara’s grid fragmented into HU-1 through the core of the 8th Pleiadian star,
forming 12 planets that became Earth’s solar system. Many of the Immortal Souls of Tara were
fragmented into HU-1 with the lost portions of Tara; they became known as the Lost Souls of
Tara or the Fallen Angels. The Palaidorian and Ur-Tarranate races of Tara created a project
through which the lost souls of Tara could re-evolve into their original 12 strand DNA immortal
imprint and be freed from HU-1.
The Sphere of Amenti  race morphogenetic field was created to give the soul fragments of Tara
that were lost in the Earth’s dimensional fields the pattern of the 12 strand DNA imprint, through
which they could re-evolve into their original Turaneusiam form. The Sphere of Amenti served as
a Host Matrix (surrogate morphogenetic field or “form-holding blueprint”) through which the
Lost Souls of Tara could evolve and return home. The Amenti rescue mission represents a Host Soul
Matrix Transplant on the species level. All present Earthly strains of human have evolved through the
morphogenetic imprint of the Sphere of Amenti.
Seeding the 12 Tribes of Amenti:  Through the Sphere of Amenti race morphogenetic field 7 Root<br />
Races and 5 Cloister Races  were created, through which the 12 strand DNA imprint could be
rooted into Earth biology to evolve. The first 2 Root races were etheric in nature and evolved on
HU-3 D-7 Gaia, setting the pattern of the 1st DNA strand into Earth’s planetary morphogenetic field.
The remaining 5 Root Races &amp; 5 Cloister Races were to be seeded on Earth &amp; Tara during
different time periods. Each Root Race would assemble and evolve 1 DNA strand imprint from Amenti
into Earth’s biological gene pool. The Cloister Race appearing with each Root Race would evolve the
imprints for strands 7-12 as dormant gene codes along with the imprint for the strand carried by their
Root Race. The Cloister Races allowed the strands of cellular transmutation to remain alive within the
biological gene pool.
The 3 Seedings:  The Amenti Rescue Mission failed twice due to Interstellar Wars over humanity’s
right to evolve on Earth. The Palaidorians, Ur-Tarranates &amp; other guardian races of Tara, HU-2
and HU-3 had to re-seed all but the first and second Root and Cloister Races 3 different times. The
present human lineage is part of the 3rd Seeding. Present day humans are primarily of the 5th Root
Race Aryan  and Hibiru  Cloister Race strains. Some members of the 6th Cloister Race, the
Melchizedeks , are also present on Earth and 150,000 7th Race Paradisian  souls, the
Indigo Children , will be incarnating on Earth between 1999 - 2017 to accelerate the genetic
evolution of the races and to help Earth shift to the Bridge Zone time continuum.
The Arc of the Covenant  is a time portal passage between Earth and the Andromeda galaxy
that was created 840,000 years ago by guardian races. I was used to store and protect the
Sphere of Amenti until the Sphere could be returned to Earth’s core. The Arc allowed the Sphere
of Amenti to descend from Andromeda when Earth’s core reached a high enough vibration rate.
Races of the 3rd Seeding were birthed into ﬂesh through the Arc of the Covenant. Arc was originally
called the Arch of the Covenant of Palaidor, denoting the Palaidorian Covenant through which the
Amenti Rescue Mission was begun 550 million years ago.<br />

                                              THE SIX SILENT ASCENSION A V ATARS
  During the ascension cycle of 2017 AD six avatar souls will incarnate on
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Earth in order to serve various roles within the plan of human ascension and
evolution. An avatar soul is a soul essence possessing a minimum level of
over-soul consciousness, fully embodied within the physical incarnation; it is
a master-soul that incarnates from a position within Harmonic Universe 3 or
4. An avatar will have a minimum of 7-dimensional frequency bands within
its genetic imprint, and a minimum of seventh DNA strand activation at
birth. The human genetic prototype can hold only 12-dimensional frequency
bands within its imprint, a 12-strand DNA code. Avatars will thus have
between 7 and 12 DNA strands activated in their genetic code. (The last
12th-level avatar to incarnate on Earth was Jesheua-12, AKA  Jesus Christ/
Sananda - 12BC - 27 AD). The six Silent Ascension Avatars assisting in the
2017 ascension cycle will be born approximately four years apart beginning in
1992, the last being born in 2012. Though there will be several other avatar
souls incarnating on Earth during this period, the six Silent Ascension Ava-
tars hold a very special purpose of realigning the DNA imprint for the human
race within the morphogenetic field of the Sphere of Amenti.<br />
As their respective soul essences pass through the Sphere of Amenti, the
frequency bands carried in their energetic essence will purge mutations from
the human DNA imprint, allowing DNA strands 2-7 to realign with the orig-
inal 12-strand DNA pattern of the HU-2 Turaneusiam-human prototype.
Without the birth of these avatars mutations within the human DNA code
would prevent humans from properly assembling and activating the DNA
strands and humanity would be unable to achieve acceleration of evolution
and ascension to the Bridge Zone, Tara or beyond. Each avatar is assigned to
the realignment of one DNA strand, which will be achieved as the soul
essence passes through the Sphere of Amenti during fetal integration.<br />
When the avatars turn 12 years of age they will begin awakening to their
chosen service mission on Earth and by age 22, if their awakening proceeds
properly, they are scheduled to begin active service to further the evolution-
ary development of humans within the Bridge Zone Earth. The success of the
ascension program is dependent upon the births of the six Silent Ascension
Avatars proceeding according to schedule. They are called the Silent Avatars
because their identities, religious affiliations and geographical locations will
be undisclosed to the public during the ascension period. Their identities will
not be revealed until they have reached the age of 33 and their service mis-
sions come into mass awareness.<br />

                         THE THREE TRACKS OF TIME  
</pre></div>

<p>Earth’s populations will permanently divide into three separate groups
2012-2017<br />
Time Track 1—Voyager Ascension—Tara D-4 Time Cycle<br />
Time-traveling V oyagers - 5532.5-year Leap into the Future (Tara AD<br />
7549.5)<br />
•   Humans who are able to assemble and activate a minimum of the fifth
DNA strand will have the opportunity to transmute the body structure into
light &amp; teleport through the portal passages of the Halls of Amenti to arrive
on planet Tara. Tara is Earth in the future space-time coordinates of the Har-
monic Universe-2 time cycles. Transfer to Tara represents a 5532.5-year time-
travel journey into the future. Humans teleporting/time-traveling to Tara are
called V oyagers.<br />
•   V oyagers will experience subtle or direct contact by other V oyagers, ET
or metaterrestrial guardian groups prior to the ascension period, through
which they will receive training &amp; make travel arrangements. V oyagers must
complete a minimum of two Stellar Activations to biologically tolerate trans-
port to Tara. V oyagers who are near 5 DNA strand assembly but assembly is
not quite complete cannot pass through Amenti directly. They will be pri-
vately escorted to guardian Transport landing sites &amp; will travel to Tara via
interdimensional spacecraft.<br />
•   Once arriving on Tara V oyagers will be given lodging &amp; will attend ori-
entation classes to assist them with integration into Taran society as time-
travelers from the past. Taran culture is built upon the Law of One &amp; is quite
Heavenly compared to Earthly existence.<br />
•   V oyagers will find themselves in less-dense, more perfected versions of
their present bodies, free from disease, the necessity of death and the cycles of
reincarnation in HU-1.<br />
•   Humans who have assembled the fifth DNA strand, but whose physical
bodies are beyond repair &amp; will not permit the strand to activate, will physi-
cally die in usual terms then pass through the Halls of Amenti as conscious-
ness, to incarnate into an immortal body through a Taran parent couple.<br />
•   In some cases couples or groups will be able to ascend together &amp; will
be able to remain together on Tara if they choose to do so.<br />
•   Full memory of multidimensional experience will return to the V oyag-
ers &amp; they will have open relationships with ET and metaterrestrial commu-
nities while evolving on Tara.<br />
• Few will take the path of the V oyager, but it is the path of choice &amp; the
opportunity of many life times for those who can qualify.<br />

<p>Data Summaries and At-A-Glance Blow-Up Charts<br />
Time Track 2—Phantom Earth Descending Planet—D-3 Time Cycle<br />
Descending Humans — Return to the Present (Earth AD 2017)<br />
• Humans who do not assemble all of the fourth and _ of the fifth DNA
strands will remain within the D-3 time cycle when Earth completes the
ascension period in 2017 and will follow the path of the Phantom Earth
Descending planet. If the Dracos-Zeta Resistance is successful in orchestrat-
ing the Frequency Fence in 2004, these populations will fall under covert
Dracos-Zeta bio-neurological mind control.<br />
• Major Earth changes will occur on the Phantom Earth, due to the Fre-
quency Fence and Descending Humans will face disruptions in existing social
structure &amp;  in filtration of the Dracos-Zeta hybrids.<br />
• If the Frequency Fence is stopped, Descending Humans will face Earth
changes to a lesser degree and retain their existing level of freedom of choice,
but will become bio-energetically severed from their higher-dimensional
identity, Soul Matrix and evolutionary blueprint. This separation from the
Soul Matrix will cause a genetic mutation through which only the third
DNA strand can assemble. Over several generations this mutation will cause
break down of the genetic code and the inability to reproduce.<br />
• Descending Humans will no longer be able to access multidimensional
awareness and will be unable to ascend out of HU-1 after death or reincar-
nate without a Host Matrix Transplant. Without an energetic link to a Soul
Matrix the consciousness becomes finite and will eventually fragment into
the Uni fied Field of HU-1 as undifferentiated units of consciousness.<br />
• Experientially , Descending Humans will face some degree of Earth
changes, an acceleration of disease &amp; deterioration during the ascension
period and will find that portions of Earth’s populations have literally van-
ished without a trace following 2017.<br />
• Earth’ s primary particle base and morphogenetic field will transfer to
the Bridge Zone, D-3 Earth will represent the Phantom particle base left over
from Earth’s transition &amp; will become a Descending Planet, unable to evolve
out of the HU-1 time cycles.<br />
• This is the least favorable path, with far reaching evolutionary conse-
quences, but will be experienced by large numbers of the population if they
do not rapidly awaken &amp; take responsibility for conscious evolution.

                                              Time Track 3—Night of the Two Moons—  
                                       Bridge Zone Earth—Agartha—D-3.5 Time Cycle     
        Bridging Humans – Earth’ s 2213-year Leap into the Future (Agartha AD 5336.5)  
      
    • Humans who achieve assembly &amp; activation of all of the fourth &amp; _ of
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>the fifth DNA strand &amp; who complete a minimum of 1.5 Stellar Activations
will be able to pass into the Bridge Zone-Agartha time continuum with Earth
in 2017. The primary 3-dimensional particle base of Earth, Earth’s core mor-
phogenetic field &amp; the Sphere of Amenti race morphogenetic field will make
this transition. Some localized Earth changes may occur in regions of grid
instability as Earth transitions to the Bridge Zone. Transfer to the Bridge
Zone represents a planetary acceleration of time, through which Earth will
shift to a space-time location 2213-years in the future, from its present space-
time station.<br />
• Bridging Humans will perceive a progressively more distinct separation
of those following the old paradigm &amp; the new as 2012 approaches &amp; popula-
tions begin to group by higher &amp; lower particle pulsation rhythms. These
groups will literally “fall out of each other’s range of perception” by 2017. Peo-
ple of the new paradigm will progressively experience more rapid expansion
of consciousness &amp; multidimensional perception, as a natural part of the
Stellar Activations they will encounter.<br />
• Bridging Humans will experience more noticeable change than
Descending Humans will as Earth completes the 2017 transition. During the
3-day particle conversion period of 2017 they will find that many structures
that are composed of lower vibrating, inorganic substances &amp; Descending
populations, will literally vanish or de-manifest. The most apparent change
will be in the sudden appearance of buildings &amp; other structures of civiliza-
tion that were not there before, as portions of Agartha become visible. lt will
seem as if these structures “had always been there but had been forgotten”.
This will cause a bit of temporary space-time &amp; memory disorientation for
Bridging Humans as their neurological structures adjust to the new electro-
magnetic pulsation rhythms of the Bridge Zone.<br />
•Bridging Humans will have the opportunity to become V oyagers
through the natural acceleration of DNA assembly that will occur as a result
of Bridge Zone Earth’s Stellar Activations.<br />
• Those who do not V oyage will evolve within a more enlightened Earth
culture, in which new forms of free energy &amp; Keylontic science applications
are discovered.<br />
• Perceptually , Bridging Humans will experience a sense of less weight
within the atmosphere &amp; their physical bodies &amp; the body will have a
renewed sense of energy, health &amp; vitality. As the higher chakra centers acti-
vate conscious integration of the soul identity will accelerate.<br />

<p>Data Summaries and At-A-Glance Blow-Up Charts
•   During the 3-day period populations of Bridge Zone Earth may experi-
ence the visual phenomenon of the appearance of bright moon halos or two
distinct moons, thus the Bridge Zone is known as the path of the Night of the
two Moons.
•   Bridging Humans will be free from Dracos-Zeta manipulation &amp; will
have progressively more open relations with guardian ET cultures.
•  The Halls of Amenti ascension passages &amp; the Hall of Records race
history will be open to populations of Bridge Zone Earth &amp; a new age of
enlightenment will begin.
•   The Bridge Zone represents the ful fillment of a guardian initiated Earth
rescue mission through which the integrity of the human evolutionary blue-
print will be secured. Bridge Zone Earth is the second most desirable path &amp;
one that will be taken by about 8% of Earth’s populations.</p>

</div>
<p>mined by your choices now. The key to ascending to the Bridge Zone or Tara
is Bodily Transmutation, which is achieved through the rapid assembly and
activation of DNA strands &amp; the awakening of dormant gene codes. DNA
evolution can be accelerated by consciously using the bio-energetic chakra
system to activate the dormant Star Crystal Seals within the human body &amp;
bio-energetic field. These hidden morphogenetic seals control the operation
of the DNA and when activated allow for transmutation of the cellular struc-
ture from one space-time station to others. Earth’s upcoming Transmutative
Stellar Activation period will allow humanity the opportunity for rapid Star
Crystal Seal activation &amp; DNA acceleration, through which transmutative
self-evacuation from Descending Earth can be achieved. You have free will to
choose what future you will see, within the greater framework of Earth’s evo-
lutionary course; this course now offer three primary options.

</div>
<p>mensional, perpetual motion universe. lt is the primary foundation upon
which all advanced sciences and technologies of light, sound, frequency, and
electromagnetic energy are built. Keylontic Science deals with the underly-
ing structures of electromagnetic energy through which all matter forms are
constructed and with the attributes of electro-tonal energy structure through
which consciousness achieves diversification and individuation. Foundations
of Keylontic Science arise out of a larger category of multidimensional scien-
tific study known as the Science of Vibrational Mechanics . The Science of
Vibrational Mechanics utilizes a schematic of cosmic order that is created
through the inherent dynamics of fission and fusion of electro-tonal energy
units, an order through which the natural laws of the cosmos are set and held
in motion. Keylontic Science employs these natural laws as they apply to the
structures and dynamics of energy, matter and consciousness that are created
through these laws. Keylonta can be viewed as the science of creation, for it is
through the dynamics of Keylontic Science that creation takes place. There
is an organizational intelligence and sentient creative force of vast propor-
tions that is responsible for the design and creation of the cosmos. Through
Keylontic Science we can explore the dynamics of energy and consciousness
through which the cosmos and all forms and beings within it, receive this
design through the Central Creative Source.<br />
The cosmic schematic is organized into a formation of two polarized
Cosmic Cores and 12 Meta-Galactic Cores, both united through and existing
within the Central Source of Creation. The Guardians refer to this Central
Source as the Yunasai and it is the sentient, creative identity-in-energy

through and within which the cosmos and its parts manifest. The 12 Meta-
Galactic Cores of the cosmos pair to form six primary reality fields in which
multidimensional reality systems take place.<br />
Each of the six pairs of reality fields contains two 15-dimensional systems,
that are referred to as 15-dimensional Matrices.  In one 15-dimensional
Matrix there is one set of 15 dimensions that compose the particle universe
and one set of counter-rotating 15 dimensions that compose the anti-particle
reﬂection of the parallel universe. All life, evolution and form manifestation
takes place within the six 15-dimensional Matrices. The principles of energy
and consciousness that form these reality fields are the same as those that
manifest life forms and sentient consciousness within these fields; the same
dynamics of energy inter-relationships apply to the macrocosm and the
microcosm. The science of Keylonta allows us to study ourselves as interwo-
ven integral parts of this greater structure of the cosmos.<br />
Keylontic Science has many diverse applications from communication,
healing, acceleration of the genetic code and advancement of spiritual evolu-
tion to the creation of advanced technologies such as manufacture of interdi-
mensional transport craft and free energy devices to the maneuvering of
time-space portals. Mastery of multidimensional science requires having
knowledge of the minute, electro-tonal units of energy that form all particles
and frequency bands within dimensional systems and the dynamics of elec-
tro-magnetism created through the interplay of these ultra-micro energy
units. Consciousness and matter are both composed of these units of electro-
tonal energy and so both spiritual and scienti fic mastery are brought together
through the applied knowledge of these electro-tonal energy dynamics. Key-
lontic Science provides the foundations of knowledge upon which mastery of
matter and consciousness can be achieved.<br />
Keylontic Science derives its name from the word Keylon.  A Keylon is a
composite of ultra-micro electro-tonal energy units called Partiki.  Keylons
group with other Keylons to form dimensionalized, crystalline structures of
energy that exist as the base morphogenetic (form-holding) templates behind
and within all matter forms, particles and consciousness. Keylons compose
the frequency fields of sound and light upon which the entire Cosmic matrix
is structured; the Uni fied Field of cosmic energy is composed of groups of
crystalline Keylons. Keylons also compose the morphogenetic template of
electro-tonal and electromagnetic energy upon which the human DNA,
genetic code, physical body, bio-energetic chakra system and multidimen-
sional aspects of consciousness (the spiritual body) are built. In studying Key-
lons and the energetic dynamics inherent to Keylontic Science we can learn
to consciously direct the path of our physical and spiritual evolution.
Through this knowledge we can one day learn to master the contours of mat-
ter and consciousness as they apply to the simultaneously co-existing space-

<p>time fields of the 15-dimensional Matrix, within which our present existence
takes place.<br />
T o begin utilizing the potentials of Keylontic Science for personal devel-
opment, we must become aware of the basic components of which our bodies,
minds, consciousness and spirit are composed. Once we are aware of our per-
sonal energetic composition, we can begin to learn how to direct our inher-
ent energy to affect desired change within the physical, emotional, mental
and spiritual aspects of our existence. Keylontic Science offers us the oppor-
tunity to explore and utilize the portions of our personal reality that presently
remain hidden from our conscious view. The basic principle in using Keylon-
tic Science is to understand the mechanics by which the elements of Keylon-
tic Science interrelate with the components of multidimensional anatomy.
The first step in the study of Keylonta is becoming familiar with the six pri-
mary elements of Keylontic Science.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>                                 SIX PRIMARY ELEMENTS OF KEYLONTIC SCIENCE       
 1. Partiki : Partiki represent the units of crystalline morphogenetic sub-
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>stance out of which particles and anti-particles emerge. Partiki are units of
electro-tonal energy-identity that emanate from a central cosmic source
called the  Y unasai.  Partiki are the primary units of energy that form all mat-
ter, anti-matter, pre-matter and non-matter substance. They are units of mul-
tidimensional light-sound and consciousness that represent minute
projections of energy-identity from the central creative cosmic source. Partiki
are the organizational intelligence and operational “life-force fuel” behind
and within all manifestations and consciousness. Partiki operate as minute
self-regenerating “ fission-fusion generators.” Through the dynamics of their
interaction they create and maintain the electromagnetic fields of sound fre-
quency and light spectra of which the cosmos is composed.<br />
Partiki are the smallest units of energy in the cosmos  (one could find 800 bil-
lion billion Partiki units in an average 3-dimensional photon). They exist
within and beyond all particle and matter structures and represent the
“divine substance” out of which the cosmos is composed. Through interior
polarization and replication, created through self-generated fission and
fusion, Partiki manufacture two intrinsic sub-units of crystalline morphoge-
netic substance that serve as blueprints for rhythms of pulsation through
which particles and anti-particles manifest. The Partiki sub-units that pulsate
the fastest are called Partika  and they set the pulsation rhythm through
which Partiki units will group to form anti-particles.<br />
Partiki sub-units that pulsate more slowly and appear in conjunction
with the Partika are called Particum.  The Particum set the pulsation rhythm
through which Partiki units will group to form particles  that are a slower pul-
sating reflection of the Partika anti-particles. Together the Partiki, Partika
and Particum set the foundations for particle and anti-particle manifestation
453</p>
<p>Introduction to Keylonta<br />
within the Uni fied Fields of the 15-dimensional Matrix. They are the ener-
getic substances, through which the base electro-magnetism that keeps the
universe and parallel universe in motion is manufactured.<br />
Each Partiki perpetually breaks down into Particum and Partika, particle
and anti-particle, while simultaneously replicating the original Partiki,
through the act of internal fission. The replication serves to retain the pat-
tern of the original, while the Particum and Partika serve to draw other Par-
tiki units from the Uni fied Field. The Particum and Partika are then
magnetically drawn back together in an act of fusion, through which they
merge with the replica of the original Partiki out of which they were created.
During fusion the Particum and Partika draw new energy patterns in the form
of Partiki units back into the morphogenetic structure of the original Partiki,
which expands the original pattern while retaining its organic integrity.
Through this process crystalline composite forms are created, which serve as
the morphogenetic blueprints through which individuated forms and identity
will manifest.<br />
The Partika perpetually circulate energy from the original Partiki
through the Cosmic Matrix and the Particum perpetually draw energy from
the Uni fied Field of the Cosmic Matrix back into the morphogenetic form of
the Partiki, expanding its original form. Through this dynamic a perpetual
motion, expanding and contracting universe and parallel universe are perpet-
ually re-created and eternally sustained.<br />
Partiki can be viewed in spiritual terms as units of the identity of  God, the cen-
tral creative source . All things are composed of Partiki and thus all things,
beings and consciousness are intrinsically holy as they are composed of and
united through the eternal substance of God. This God-substance of Partiki
allows for individuation of form and identity to be created, creates diversi fica-
tion through a greater field of uni fied consciousness and manufactures the
morphogenetic design through which all individuation and manifestation
takes place.<br />
2. Partiki Grids: Partiki units group by like polarization, electrical Par-
tika to Partika, magnetic Particum to Particum, forming strings of energy
units called Partiki Strands.  Partiki Strands group with other such strands to
form geometrical “fabrics” or grids of electro-tonal, electromagnetic energy
that serve as a template of light spectra and sound tones upon which particle
and anti-particle structure forms. These templates of Partiki units are called
Partiki Grids  and they form a Uni fied Field of living energy substance
through which all things in the cosmos are energetically united.<br />
All forms of matter and consciousness possess a Partiki Grid at the core of
their individual structure that holds the morphogenetic imprint for the form
or identity and the intrinsic base pattern for the particles and anti-particles
that will manifest that form into matter. The personal Partiki Grid is inti-
mately interwoven with the greater Partiki Grid of the Cosmic Uni fied Field.

<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>                                                                     Six Primary Elements of Keylontic Science
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>All things are eternally, energetically connected to the energy-identity of the
Yunasai/God through the electro-tonal, electromagnetic reality of the Partiki
Grids. Following the pattern of organizational intelligence set by the Yunasai
and carried within the Partiki units, Partiki Grids draw in more units of Par-
tiki from the Uni fied Field, forming more complex geometrical arrangements
of Partiki Strands which become the crystalline dimensionalized templates
upon which all forms are constructed. Partiki strands represent the fibers out
of which individuated morphogenetic fabrics are woven and are the second
state of being between pure conscious energy-identity and manifestation of
form.<br />
Partiki Grids represent the morphogenetic fabrics into which tapestries of crys-
talline matter blueprints are laid and are the third state of being between pure con-
sciousness and manifestation of form.<br />
3. Keylons:  Keylons are dimensionalized, geometrically formed Partiki
composites, composed of more complex arrangements of Partiki Strands that
form around the base structure of the Partiki Grids. Keylons are minute crys-
talline structures composed of Partiki that form the dimensionality of con-
sciousness and matter. Keylons and the Partiki within them are the “building
blocks of frequency” or sound tones, which are the core structures upon
which matter and consciousness are built. Keylons direct the rhythm of
expansion-projection and contraction-retraction of Partiki units throughout
the cosmos and within the Partiki Grids of all forms. They set the foundation
structures upon which biology and the perception of space, time and matter
are built. Partiki units set the base electromagnetic fields through which
dimensionalization takes place and Keylons direct the contours of how Par-
tiki units will build up into form within those electromagnetic fields. Keylons
form the crystalline matrix of electro-tonal energy that runs through all
things.<br />
Keylons represent the primary tapestries of crystalline morphogenetic matter
blueprints upon which sub. particle and sub-anti-particle pre-matter substance will
form. Keylons are the fourth step between pure consciousness and form manifesta-
tion.
4. Keylon Codes:  A Keylon Code is a complex grouping of Keylons that
further direct the contours of energy upon which forms are built. Keylon
Codes serve to direct the in- ﬂow and out- ﬂow of Partiki unit energy within
the morphogenetic blueprint of a form into more specific patterns, rhythms of
movement and electro-tonal vibration. All forms of matter and conscious-
ness are structured upon speci fic sets of Keylon Codes that determine the base
atomic and genetic makeup of a form and the characteristics of consciousness
the form will possess. Keylon Codes represent complex patterns of interwo-
ven sound tones and light spectra that form compound morphogenetic crys-
talline structures that serve as the templates of living light and sound to
455</p>
<p>Introduction to Keylonta<br />
which pre-matter sub-particles and matter and anti-matter particles will
adhere.<br />
Keylon Codes create and hold together the primary morphogenetic
structure of individuated form; they are the primary structure and organiza-
tional collective intelligence within all things. The manifest attributes of all
matter forms and consciousness can be affected through directed alteration of
existing Keylon Code structures.<br />
Keylon Codes represent the compound tapestries of crystalline morphogenetic
matter blueprints upon which pre-matter, anti-matter and matter particles will
form. They are the ﬁfth state of being between pure consciousness and form mani-
festation and serve as the complex, multidimensional, morphogenetic blueprint
through which all individuated forms manifest.<br />
5. The Crystal Body:  This term is used to refer to the multidimensional
Keylon Code structure of a matter form or form of consciousness. The Crystal
Body represents the individuated morphogenetic construction of a form
through which the contours of its manifest attributes will take shape. The
morphogenetic Crystal Body sets the manifest characteristics a form will pos-
sess, its intrinsic sub-atomic structure, body rhythms, metabolic rate and the
foundations of DNA, the manner in which Partiki units will move through
the form and the type of conscious awareness the form will embody. The
human Crystal Body encompasses 12 dimensions of identity, sound frequency
and light spectra and sets the structure for the bio-energetic chakra system,
auric field and electromagnetic Merkaba Fields (counter-rotating spirals of
multidimensional electromagnetic energy through which the auric field is
formed).<br />
The Crystal Body represents the collective ﬁfth state of being between pure con-
sciousness and form manifestation, in relation to an individuated construction of
consciousness or matter . Through the Crystal Body the electromagnetic Merk-
aba Fields of a form are designed and constructed.<br />
The Merkaba Fields represent the sixth state of being between pure conscious-
ness and form manifestation.  Through the counter rotating electromagnetic
fields of the Merkaba Fields the contours for the bio-energetic auric field and
chakra system are formed in accordance with the design set by the Crystal
Body.<br />
The bio-energetic auric ﬁeld and chakra systems represent the seventh state of
being between consciousness and manifestation.  The bio-energetic field then
serves to direct Partiki units from the Dimensional Unified Fields into parti-
cle or anti-particle construction through which the DNA and biological par-
ticle base of a form is set in to the dimensional framework. Through the bio-
energetic system the pre-matter construction of a biological form is created.
This pre-matter construction is referred to as the Nadis  and Nadial Capsule.
The Nadial Capsule separates the levels of the auric field and the identity
into 3-dimensional divisions and the Nadis serve as a system of minute pre-
456</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>                                          Six Primary Elements of Keylontic Science  
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>matter channels through which Partiki unit energy from the auric field ﬂows
into the particle manifestation of the body.<br />
The Nadis and Nadial Capsule represent the eighth state of being between con-
sciousness and manifestation. The particle and anti-particle construction which
builds up through the pre-matter Nadis into a form’s manifest particles or anti-parti-
cles following the design set by the Crystal Body, represent the ninth state of being
between consciousness and manifestation.  The multidimensional spiritual body
of the Soul Matrix and Over-Soul Matrix are part of the individuated mor-
phogenetic Crystal Body of humans, and these aspects of Eternal identity are
composed of Keylon Codes, Keylons and Partiki units, just as the physical
body is composed of these substances. The Crystal Body serves as the under-
lying structure of all matter and consciousness, connects the physical aspects
of being and identity to the multidimensional Soul and Over-Soul Matrices
and connects each individuated form to the greater Crystal Body of the Cos-
mic Uni fied Field. Through directed interaction with the morphogenetic
Crystal Body both genetic and spiritual aspects of human evolution can be
expanded and accelerated.<br />
6. Light-symbol Codes:  A Light-Symbol Code is a pattern of electro-
tonal energy composed of speci fic Partiki configurations that make up fre-
quencies of sound and spectra of light. These patterns of light and sound
direct the speed, angles of interface and patterns of refraction and replication
that Partiki units will follow within the Keylon Code structure of the Crystal
Body. Light-Symbol Codes control the way energy will move and manifest
within a form; they serve as the organizational “program” within all Keylons.
By altering the Light-Symbol Code program within the Keylon Codes of the
morphogenetic Crystal Body, the structure of the Keylon Codes and thus the
manifestations they create can be changed.<br />
Human evolution of body and consciousness can be accelerated by acti-
vating certain Light-Symbol Codes that are presently dormant within the
Keylon Code structure of the Crystal Body. Once activated these dormant
Light-Symbol Codes direct the morphogenetic Crystal Body, bioenergetic
auric field and chakra system and DNA to operate in new ways. Light-Sym-
bol Codes direct sound tones and light spectra within the contours of the
Crystal Body. This directive serves to control the relationships between Par-
tiki units in the Crystal Body, which translates into operational instructions
for the bio-energetic system and DNA to follow. Light-Symbol Codes can be
used to direct patterns of frequency into the bio-energetic field and DNA in
very speci fic ways that will allow dormant potentials of the DNA to come
into operation. The DNA directs the manifest functions of the physical body
and the physically embodied consciousness, following the design set by the
Light-Symbol Code program within the Crystal Body.<br />
Cellular Transmutation can be achieved by adding new frequency pat-
terns into the Crystal Body by changing the program of the Light-Symbol
457</p>
<p>Introduction to Keylonta
Codes to hold the new frequency patterns. The use of internal and external
sound frequencies, light spectra and electromagnetic emanations creates hid-
den Light-Symbol Codes within the Crystal Body, which can program the
body toward health and wellness or disease and deterioration. The mind can
be used to direct speci fic Light-Symbol Codes and the electro-tonal programs
they carry into the Crystal Body to create healing, expansion of the genetic
code and conscious awareness and acceleration of multidimensional physical
and spiritual evolution. Through conscious direction of the Light-Symbol
Code programs the body can be freed from its present space-time orientation
by altering the particle pulsation rhythms of the body’s dimensional particle
base, once the genetic code has been expanded.<br />
Keylontic Science employs knowledge of the interrelationships between
these six primary elements to integrate the aspects of multidimensional iden-
tity and to create positive change and acceleration of evolution for all life
forms in the cosmos. Keylonta is also used to create tactile technologies that
assist in harmonious evolutionary progression. Keylontic Science is the study
of morphogenetic fields and the processes by and through which conscious-
ness becomes manifest. Units of identity from the central creative source
move through and build themselves up within the following states of being,
to become manifest forms and individuated identities as they evolve within
the 15-dimensional system:</p>

</ol>
<p>The Science of Keylonta can be viewed as the science of Light and
Sound (electro-tonal units of Partiki), the Sub-conscious Symbol Codes
(Light-Symbol Codes that program the Crystal Body and operate on a sub-
conscious level) and the Base Codes of Matter (the crystalline Keylon Codes

</div>
<p>that make up the morphogenetic Crystal Body and form the basis of all struc-
ture). In simple terms Keylonta is the science of Creation and Consciousness,
through which mastery of mind and matter can be achieved and by which spiritual
integration and reunion with our creative Source is accomplished . The dynamics of
Keylonta continually operate within every human being and connect each
human to everything in the cosmos, regardless of whether humanity is con-
scious of this process. The science of Keylonta allows humans to become con-
scious co-creators within the multidimensional reality fields of the cosmos.
Keylonta is the scientific reality behind all of the sacred practices of religions
and mystical traditions. It represents the place where science meets its soul
and religion acknowledges the dynamics of energetic reality inherent to
spirit. Keylonta is the science of the future and of the ancient past, reaching
backward and forward through time to help humanity rediscover sovereignty
over its being today.<br />
Example of a Partiki Grid
“Lines of Light,” composed
of minute, electro-tonal Par-
tiki strands cross over and
through each other, creating
a myriad of geometrical
forms that serve as a “fabric
of light and sound,” or Par-
tiki Grid . The Partiki Grid
serves as a “collector” of Par-
tiki units, pulling in new
Partiki. As Partiki units
build up within the Partiki
grid, they begin to form more
complex structures of elec-
tro-tonal impulse that
become imbedded in the grid
as crystalline Keylon configurations, or Keylon Codes . The Keylon codes set
and hold the structure for all manifestations of matter, pre-matter, anti-mat-
ter and energy fields. Partiki Grids create  the Unified Field of Energy and
Consciousness,  within which all things in the dimensionalized universe
reside and Keylon Codes create individuation of form and consciousness
within the Unified Field. Keylon Codes direct the patterns of Partiki fission/
fusion and the patterns of refraction and replication of electro-tonal energy
that allow for differentiation of form and consciousness within the unified
Partiki grid of  the Cosmic Matrix.<br />

                                               WELCOME TO THE FIFTH WORLD
Many tribal cultures throughout our recent history have shared a rich tra-
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>dition of prophecy regarding the transitions Earth will encounter during its
2017 ascension cycle. Prophecies of events to come during this period have
been interwoven with race creation stories and mythologies for over 26,556
years. Though the Bridge Zone Project is a new addition to the roster of
events soon scheduled to occur, intuitive knowledge of the ascension cycle
period and the close of the 26,556-year Euiago time cycle has remained alive
within numerous cultures of Earth for thousands of years. This hidden knowl-
edge has shown itself within the Biblical prophecies of Revelations; it was the
foundation for many rites of passage among the Essenes and other historical
mystical societies.<br />
Reference to this ascension cycle can be found within the calculations of
the Mayan calendar and inscriptions within the ancient Egyptian pyramids
and this knowledge has played a major role within the rich tapestry of Native
American oral tradition. The knowledge that Earth and the human race
would face something monumental during the “end times” has been the com-
prehension of visionaries throughout the course of recorded history. The “end
times” represent the point in Earth’s evolution when the planet has com-
pleted a cycle of 26,556 years and moves forward through its ascension period
to begin a new cycle.<br />
Our upcoming “end times” hold a promise not present during the end
times of past 26,566-year cycles, for this is the first time the planetary grid
will vibrate high enough to allow planetary dimensional ascension to take
place. This opportunity has not been available on Earth for over 200,000
years. The Bridge Zone Project is made possible precisely because Earth is
approaching the end of its present time cycle. If it were not for the Bridge
Zone Project, Earth would once again be unable to ful fill the promise of
ascension, as without guardian intervention Earth’s grid would not have
reached the necessary level of vibration. The planet would have remained
within the HU-1 dimensions for another 26,566-year cycle. The new cycle
would have reached an early close with the destruction of Earth before the
next ascension period occurred.<br />

World to the Fifth World. The transition is perceived in relation to a much
longer cycle of history in which humanity evolved through three previous
“worlds,” or time periods marked by advanced civilization and high techno-
logical achievement. Contemporary historical analysis does not yet include
these hidden aspects of human evolution. The truth of humanity’s lost past
has remained protected through cultures living more closely in harmony with
the Earth’s natural cycles. We are indeed now approaching the Fifth World.<br />

Welcome to the Fifth W orld!<br />
Between 5/ 5/2000-2017 Earth will make its transition from the present
Fourth W orld of the D-3 time cycle, into the Fifth W orld of the Bridge Zone
and Taran ascension time cycles. Due to the Guardians’ Bridge Zone Project ,
the cataclysmic events originally associated with the ‘’end times’’ prophecies
have been largely avoided. Though there may still be warfare and geographi-
cal changes in some areas, the scale of these events will be much smaller than
those foretold through ancient prophecies. There will indeed be a ‘’cleans-
ing,’’ as predicted by some Native American traditions. As the Earth sepa-
rates into higher and lower vibrating particle bases, Bridge Zone Earth and
Phantom Earth each will be ‘’cleansed’’ of the other . Populations of the
Bridge Zone Earth will rise to face a new dawn of evolution within the new
Fifth W orld of enlightenment, progress and achievement. Those on Phantom
Earth will not make this transition and will remain within the digressing
Fourth W orld evolutionary cycle of a Descending Planet in the D-3 time con-
tinuum.<br />

Earth is approaching a time continuum shift between 5/5/2000-2017.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This continuum shift represents a literal planetary time acceleration. Time
accelerations constitute an increase in particle pulsation rhythm for the
three-dimensional particle base of Earth. The human body exists as an intrin-
sic part of the particle content of Earth. As Earth’s particle base accelerates in
pulsation rhythm, the particles that compose the human auric field will also
increase in pulsation rhythm. If the physical body and bio-neurological struc-
ture of the body are not prepared to synthesize the faster pulsating particles of
the auric field, this time acceleration will manifest as acceleration of the cel-
lular deterioration process.<br />
For the body to retain its vitality through the Earth’s time acceleration,
the particle pulsation rhythm of the body’s three-dimensional particle base
must also increase. The Morphogenetic Seed Crystal Seals within the bio-
energetic system of the human body keep the body’s particle base locked into
the pulsation rhythms of dimensions 1-3. In order to accelerate the pulsation
rhythm of the body’s particles, the Seed Crystal Seals must be released, to
unlock the body’s particles from the pulsation rhythms of dimensions l-3.
Seed Crystal Seals are opened by activation of the body’s Morphogenetic Star
Crystal Seals.<br />
Star Crystal Seals are activated by awakening the dormant morphoge-
netic chakra centers and drawing new frequency patterns through the chakra
system and into the Star Crystal Seals. Activation and release of the Crystal
Seals creates activation of the dormant Silicate Matrix DNA Fire Codes
which in turn manufactures blood-crystal structures that raise the body’s met-
abolic rate and prepare the body for cellular acceleration. Stellar Activations
and Wave Infusions  are the process by which the Star Crystal Seals are acti-
vated and  Stellar Spiral Alignments  are the catalysts through which Stellar
Activations can occur. Humans who complete a minimum of 1.5 Stellar
Activations will be able to raise the particle pulsation rate of the body suffi-
ciently to avoid adverse effects of Earth’s time acceleration. The following

<p>and human bodies, are manifested through a morphogenetic (form-holding)
imprint, which exists as a quantity of crystalline, electro-tonal energetic sub-
stance that is composed of speci fic patterns of frequency. This morphogenetic
imprint sets the pattern for a form within the 15-dimensional Uni fied Field of
energy substance. The morphogenetic imprint holds the instructions and
design for form-building in a type of digital or electronic encoding, known as
Keylon Codes. Forms come into manifestation and evolve, as patterns of fre-
quency are drawn into the form’s morphogenetic field, from the dimensional
frequency bands of the Uni fied Field of energetic substance within which the
morphogenetic field is placed. This drawing-in of frequency progressively
expands the morphogenetic field and creates evolution of form progressively
upward through the 15-dimensional universe.<br />
Within the 15-dimensional Uni fied Field, the morphogenetic field cre-
ates structures of multidimensional electromagnetic energy, around and
through which the matter form will manifest. These multidimensional EM
fields are collectively referred to as the bio-energetic system or the auric field
of a manifest form. All manifest forms possess a bio-energetic system/auric
field. The auric field has seven primary, inner layers through which physical
manifestation takes place and which correspond to dimensional frequency
bands 1 through 7. The auric field also has seven outer layers, which repre-
sent the form-holding morphogenetic imprints for the seven inner layers of
the auric field. The seven outer layers correspond to dimensional frequency
bands 9 through 15. The 14 layers of the auric field are connected to each
other through a central point within the eighth dimension Meta-galactic
Core. This center point represents the point through which a form’s original
morphogenetic imprint was entered into the 15-dimensional system.<br />
All forms and beings are thus indelibly connected to each other and the
universe through interwoven morphogenetic fields that are united through
the D-8 center point. Energy moves from the seven outer morphogenetic lay-
ers of the auric field, through the seven inner layers and into manifestation
within dimensions 1-7, through the structure of dimensional Merkaba Fields
(sets of counter-rotating, electromagnetic energy spirals). Each form has fif-
teen dimensional Merkaba Fields, which hold its morphogenetic imprint
intact within the 15-dimensional Uni fied Field. Through the rotation of the</p>
