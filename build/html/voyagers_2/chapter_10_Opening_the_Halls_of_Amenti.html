                                                     CONTEXT  
  If you will recall from our discussions in earlier chapters, from 1972 for-
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>ward the Guardians had quite a few things to accomplish before the Halls of
Amenti could open between 2012 —2017. The Earth’s grid speed had to be
raised high enough by 10/1986 to spark open the first seal on the Arc of the
Covenant, so the Sphere of Amenti would descend and be in position within
Earth’s core no later than 1/1/1988. Between 1/1/1988 and 6/30/1998 the
Sphere of Amenti would transmit its D-1, D-2 and D-3 frequencies into
Earth’s grid, so by 6/30/1998 Earth’s grid speed would rise high enough to
spark the second seal on the Arc of the Covenant. Earth could then begin
ascent into the pulsation rhythms of the D-4 time cycle.<br />
If all went well, on 1/1/2000 the Sphere of Amenti would begin transmit-
ting D-4 frequency through Earth’s core and the fourth DNA strand imprint
would soon become available to the populations who had a fully assembled
third strand, into which the fourth strand could be plugged. The Blue Flame of
Amenti would begin its 12-year descent to Earth between 1/1/2000 and 5/5/2012.
On 5/5/2012  Earth would begin its intersection with T ara’ s grid, the Blue
Flame would embody within the Keepers of the Blue Flame and the masses
who had assembled the fourth DNA strand would rapidly assemble the fifth
strand for ascension to Tara.<br />
The Halls of Amenti ascension portals would open on 5/5/2012 and close
by 1/1/2022. Between 5/5/2017-6/30/2017, the Holographic Beam from D-8
would send a burst of D-7 through D-9 frequency into Earth’s grid. This D-7 -
D-9 frequency infusion would finalize the separation of the Bridge Zone and
Descending Earth time continua, then each version of Earth would move for-
ward in its respective track of time. The Guardians would have 10 years,
between 2012 —2022, to ascend as many people as possible through the Halls of
Amenti to Tara in HU-2 and three days for ascension to Gaia in the HU-3 time
cycles, in 2017.<br />
185</p>
<p>Opening the Halls of Amenti<br />
Along with these events, a series of monumental occurrences were also
to take place, as Earth entered the final phases of its ascension cycle. From
1988 through 2017 the natural seals of Earth’s seven primary vortices/chakras
would systematically open, as six Stellar Spirals progressively came into
alignment with Earth’s Merkaba Fields. On 1/1/2000 Earth’s energetic fields
would strike an interdimensional Resonant Tone, beginning the cycle of
Earth’s Stellar Activations. The Guardians were to call a global gathering of
Light Workers on this day, for a celebration of the Day Of Transcendence,  to
assist Earth in holding the interdimensional Resonant Tone so planetary
ascension into the D-4 time cycle could begin.<br />
Earth would then experience six Stellar Activations and six Stellar W ave
Infusions between 5/5/2000 and 2017, through which the particle conversion
process of the morphogenetic wave would take place. Between 1992-5/5/
2012, six silent avatars would birth on Earth, to purge genetic mutations and
realign the imprints of DNA strands 2-7 with the 12-strand DNA imprint
within the Sphere of Amenti race morphogenetic field. Between 1999 and
2017, 150,000 lndigo Children would birth on Earth through parents with
Palaidorian Birthing Contract soul agreements, to carry the activated sixth
DNA strand imprint. Keepers of the Blue Flame and Keepers of the Violet
Flame would receive their “wake up call” and progressively undergo six Star
Crystal Stellar Activations and Wave Infusions, activating DNA strands 5-9,
between 6/1996 and 2017.<br />
Following their six Stellar Activations, the Keepers of T ara’s Blue Flame
morphogenetic field would embody the Blue Flame on 5/5/2012, and begin
initiating Stellar Activations in others who hoped to ascend through the
Halls of Amenti to Tara or Gaia. The Keepers of Gaia’s Violet Flame mor-
phogenetic field would embody the Violet Flame on 1/1/2017 and begin
ascending people to Gaia during a 3-day period in 2017. The seven planetary
dimensional Merkaba Fields between Earth in HU-1, Tara in HU-2 and Gaia
in HU-3 would progressively open to each other as Earth, Tara and Gaia
aligned with the Holographic Beam for three days in 2017. This would per-
mit full ascension through the Halls of Amenti and the Blue and Violet
Flames, into the Meta-galactic Core at D-8, for those who had fully assem-
bled the sixth DNA strand.<br />
On 9/17/2001, the Hall of Records in Giza, Egypt, would begin opening.
On 5/5/2012, the Flame Holders would activate the Hall of Records, and on
12/21/2012 the Hall of Records would begin transmitting data through
Earth’s grid, making interdimensional memory available to Earth’s popula-
tions. Throughout this multi-faceted sequence of events, the grids of Earth,
Tara and Gaia had to be kept in balance and various segments of the popula-
tion had to be guided to their appropriate ascension paths, while Guardians
continued to monitor, side step and undo manipulation tactics of the Dracos-
Zeta Resistance and D-4 Anunnaki instigators.<br />

<p>After 2022, the evolutionary path for Earth’s populations would be set,
the two versions of Earth would progress forward in their respective time
cycles, and the three divisions of Earth’s populations would embark upon
their chosen paths of future evolution.<br />
Before all of the above events could occur the Guardians had to re-align
the solar Merkaba Fields so the 11:11/12:12 Frequency Fence could come
down. Once this occurred, the arti ficial D-4 “Christ Consciousness” grid
could resume transmitting D-4 frequency into Earth core to progressively
accelerate grid speed and realign the fourth V ortex/Giza pyramid with the
Alcyone spiral, so the Holographic Beam could intersect with Earth at the
proper angle in 2017. At times, we of the Guardian Alliance shake our heads
and chuckle when we hear humans lament that “the Guardians must not be
real, or if they are real, they are uncaring, because they are not doing any-
thing to help us with the Intruder problem.” Perhaps now you can understand
what we have been doing to help you behind the scenes, and that this workload does
not allow an excessive amount of resources to be placed upon concerns of social pro-
tocol.<br />
W e will now provide an overview of the status of your ascension schedule.
10/1986 THROUGH 6/1998<br />
The Opening of Amenti — Schedule of Events<br />
What has transpired between 10/1986 and 6/1998?</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>October 1986: The Arc Of The Covenant First Seal Opened. The
Sphere Of Amenti Began Descent To Earth. The 9540 BC Quarantine
Frequency Fence Began T o Lift.  The Earth’s grid speed raised high
enough to spark open the first seal on the Arc of the Covenant and the
Sphere of Amenti began its 14-month descent into the Earth’s D-2 core.
With the release of the first Arc of the Covenant Seal, the Quarantine
Frequency Fence from 9540 BC began to disengage. Some of the third
DNA strand mutations caused by this Seal began to heal, allowing the veil
between the ego and the higher self identity aspects to begin dissolving.</p></li>
<li><p>August 16, 1987: The Harmonic Convergence. Permission For Guard-
ian lntervention On Earth Was Granted. Bridge Zone Project Was Set
In Motion. Guardians Began Keying Earth’s V ortices.  In 1987, in
response to the event of the Harmonic Convergence on 8/16/1987, the
Sirian Council persuaded the Galactic Federation and other HU-2 and
HU-3 groups to allow the ascension program to be activated for the
human populations. Permission was given for the Guardians to intervene
and set the Bridge Zone Project plan from 1984 in motion. Guardian

</ol>
<p>groups began keying Earth’s vortices with UHF seals to block Intruder
forces from using the vortex portals. Guardian and Intruder forces began
vying for control over Earth’s vortices.<br />
3.  January 1988: Sphere Of Amenti Returned To Earth’s Core And The
12-year Amenti Activation Cycle Began. Earth’s First V ortex Seal-Ari-
zona, USA-opened. Amenti’s D-1 Frequencies Began T ransmitting
Through Earth’s Grid.  The Sphere of Amenti returned to Earth’s D-2
core from the UHF bands of D-3, for the first time in about 3,500 years,
and began transmitting its D-1 frequencies into Earth’ s grid. This began
the 12-year activation process of the Sphere of Amenti, through which
the Sphere progressively opens its D-1, D-2 and D-3 frequencies into
Earth’s core D-2 morphogenetic field. This will raise the pulsation rhythm
of Earth’s particle base and the frequency of Earth’s grid, in preparation for
Earth’ s first Stellar Activation on 5/5/2000. As the Sphere of Amenti
began transmitting its D-1 frequencies through Earth’ s grid, the natural
seal on Earth’ s first primary vortex opened and the vortex began its 4-year
activation cycle. Earth’s first primary vortex/chakra is located in the
region of the Painted Desert in the state of Arizona, USA. (The Sedona,
AZ, vortices are connected to this primary vortex and they began multidi-
mensional activation at this time.)<br />
4.  September 1989: Guardians Repair Solar Fields. Guardian Transmis-
sions of D-4 Frequency to Increase Earth’s Grid Speed Begin . The Sir-
ian Council and other Guardian groups completed the realignment of the
solar Merkaba Fields, which began the realignment of Earth’s D-1 and D-2
Merkaba Fields, that had been misaligned by the Zetas following the Phil-
adelphia Experiment of 1943. This allowed D-4 frequency transmissions
from the Guardian’ s artificial “Christ Consciousness” grid to resume infu-
sion into Earth’ s core, to raise Earth’ s core frequencies. This also allowed
for the 11:11/12:12 Frequency Fence to come down, once the Earth’ s grid
re-balanced.<br />
5. January 11, 1992: The 11:11—Promise Of Ascension —Granted as
Guardians T ransmitted The 1 1 D-4 Magnetic Base Codes That W ould
Allow 1 1:1 1/12:12 Frequency Fence to Later Release.  On 1/11/1992
the Guardians began to transmit the 11 D-4 magnetic base tones that had
been removed from Earth’s morphogenetic field in 1972, to create the pro-
tective 11:11/12:12 Frequency Fence, which stopped the Red Pulse/W ave
of Solar Flame from moving through Earth and neighboring planets.
Transmission of these magnetic codes marked the beginning of the 11:11/
12:12 Frequency Fence disengagement. The Fence had blocked the third
and fourth DNA  strands from plugging into each other, which caused a
block between the D-3 personality and higher self and the astral identity .
The Fence would also block the Sphere of Amenti from transmitting D-4

  frequency into Earth’s grid in 2000. The Halls of Amenti could not open
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>while the Fence was in place. With the return of the D-4 magnetic base
tones to the Earth’ s morphogenetic field, the opening of Amenti would
continue on schedule, the third and fourth DNA  strands began to align
and astral awareness became more accessible to the 3-dimensionally con-
sciousness human identity . The date of 1/11/1992 became known as the
11:11 in New Age circles, representing the celebration of the promise of
ascension, which was granted on that date, through Earth receiving the 11
D-4 magnetic base codes that would allow the Frequency Fence to disas-
semble.<br />
6.  June 6, 1992: Earth’s Second Vortex Seal—Jerusalem, Israel —
opened; Amenti’s D-2 Frequencies Began T ransmitting Through
Earth’s Grid.  The Sphere of Amenti completed opening its D-1 frequen-
cies into Earth’ s morphogenetic field, Earth’ s first primary vortex in the
Arizona Painted Desert completely opened and activated and the seal on
Earth’s second primary vortex began to open and activate. Earth’s second
primary vortex/chakra is located in Jerusalem, Israel. The Sphere of
Amenti began transmitting its D-2 frequencies through Earth’s grid.
7 .  July 26, 1992: Avatar # 1—Seventh-level Avatar —Is Born And Aligns
DNA  Strand 2 Imprint With 12-strand Pattern; Corrected Strand 2
Imprint Begins T ransmitting Through Earth’s Grid. The first of six
Silent Avatars was born. This avatar is a D-7 soul essence from HU-3, a
seventh-level avatar, with 7-dimensional frequency bands activated in his
genetic code. This individual was born with DNA strand 7 fully activated.
As his soul essence passed through the Sphere of Amenti the imprint for
DNA  strand 2 was realigned with the 12-strand DNA  pattern and the
imprint for the aligned DNA  strand 2 began transmitting through Earth’s
grid and into the bio-energetic fields of Earth’s population.<br />
8.  December 12, 1994: The 12:12- Independence Day- Human Gradua-
tion. Changing Of The Guard Of Amenti. The 11:11/12: 12 Frequency
Fence Releases. Earth Guardianship Is Turned Over To Humanity. The
Ascension Schedule Moves Forth.  The 11 D-4 magnetic base tone codes
and electrical overtone codes of the 11:11/12:12 Frequency Fence com-
pleted re-entry into the Earth’ s D-2 morphogenetic field and the 11:11/
12:12 Frequency Fence was fully dismantled. The 12th base tone and 12th
overtone frequencies of D-4 were reconnected to the 11 D-4 base tones
and overtones within Earth’ s morphogenetic field and the Sphere of
Amenti. Human DNA  could now continue to assemble through the
fourth and fifth strand. The remaining stages of opening the Halls of
Amenti were no longer under full Guardian control, the responsibility for
humanity’s evolutionary destiny was now in human hands. The success of
the opening of  the Halls of Amenti and the Bridge Zone Project, which
189</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Opening the Halls of Amenti  
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>were previously controlled by the Guardians’ 11:11/12:12 Frequency
Fence, would now be determined by the rate at which human conscious-
ness and DNA  evolved to higher accretion levels. The Sphere of Amenti
race morphogenetic field, which had been created 550,000,000 years ago
by the Palaidorians of T ara would now be placed under Earth human
guardianship. The Ur-T arranate Palaidorian souls from HU-2, who had
merged their consciousness to form the Sphere of Amenti, began to leave
Earth and the Sphere of Amenti, to return to their HU-2 T aran reality
fields. For 550,000,000 years, the energetic substance of the Ur-Tarranate
souls and their consciousness had provided the medium through which
the lost soul fragments of T ara could evolve from HU-1, by merging their
consciousness with that of the Ur-T arranates within the Sphere of
Amenti, through evolution of the DNA. The Ur-T arranates had served as
a Host Matrix Family for the entire Earthly human lineage. The Sphere of
Amenti morphogenetic field “rescue mission” for the lost soul fragments of
T ara represents a Host Matrix Transplant, through which the entire
Earthly human lineage has evolved. When the fall from T ara occurred, the
lost souls of T ara were cut off from their soul matrices and the Turaneu-
siam-1 race morphogenetic field. The Ur-Tarranates of Amenti served as
an adoptive soul matrix through which the lost souls could re-evolve,
until they had re-built their connection to their T aran soul matrices
through assembly of the fourth and fifth DNA strand. Through the accel-
erated evolution opportunity offered by Earth’ s present ascension cycle,
fourth and fifth DNA strand assembly would allow many humans the
chance to re-connect with their personal soul matrices from HU-2. The
services of the Ur-T arranates would no longer be needed, as the humans
who made their soul matrix connection would become carriers of the
human evolutionary blueprint.<br />
The return of the race morphogenetic field to the human species could
not occur while the 11:11/12:12 Frequency Fence remained in place and
DNA strands four and five were blocked from assembly. When the Fre-
quency Fence dismantled on 12/12/1994, fourth and fifth strand assembly
once again became available to humanity. The event of Amenti’s transfer
to human guardianship can be viewed as a “Changing of the Guard”.
With the termination of the Frequency Fence, between 1/11/1992 and 12/
12/1994, the Host Matrix Family Ur-Tarranate souls began leaving Earth,
as progressively more humans re-connected to their HU-2 soul matrices.
The Ur-Tarranates involved in the Amenti project had been Earth-bound
for 550,000,000 years and could not ascend from HU-1 until this “Chang-
ing of the Guard” took place. As of 12/12/1994 the ancient Ur-Tarranate
souls from Tara could at last disengage themselves from the Sphere of
Amenti and continue on their own evolutionary journey through the

        higher Harmonic Universes. This date of 12/12/1994 became known as
     the 12:12 and represents humanity’ s true Independence Day , when the
     fate of human destiny was turned over from the custodial care of the
    ancient Ur-T arranate race and placed into the hands of an evolving
     humanity . The 12:12 stands for humanity&#39;s graduation from its adolescent
      evolution into the adult role of becoming a planetary Guardian species.
9.  1995: Guardians Initiate Portal Project To Secure Earth&#39;s Vortices
     From Intruder In filtration By 2012.  The Sirian Council became aware
    of Anunnaki Resistance plans to instigate Earth changes through D-4
     interference. The Pleiadian Star League and members of the Andromeda
      Council agreed to assist the Sirian Council in more aggressive efforts of
     frequency-keying, monitoring and protecting Earth’ s vortex/portal system
    from Anunnaki Resistance and Dracos-Zeta Resistance manipulation.
      They began the collaborative Portal Project. Guardian and Intruder forces
     have been secretly vying for portal control ever since. Presently the
     Andromies have most of Earth’s portals under protection, though Intruder
    forces continue to attempt to overtake the primary second portal vortex
     in Jerusalem and the smaller, secondary portals in Manhattan, Florida,
    Sedona, Arizona, Hawaii, Tibet, China and in other areas of the globe.
    Guardians must secure all seven primary vortex points by 2012 for the
    Bridge Zone Project and the opening of the Halls of Amenti to unfold
      smoothly , without causing grid instability and Earth changes. Humanity
     can help the Guardians in this portal protection endeavor by using
      focused group meditation to project high frequency D-4 - D-8 frequency
      into these locations and into the Earths grid in general, using “sun” visu-
        alizations.  
  10. June 1996: Earth’s Third Vortex—Himalayan Mountains—Opened.
     Amenti Began T ransmitting D-3 Frequencies Through Earth’s Grid.
     Keepers Of The Blue And Violet Flames Begin First Stellar Activation,
    The Solar-Heart Star Activation.  The Sphere of Amenti completed
     opening its D-2 frequencies into Earth’ s morphogenetic field, Earth’ s sec-
    ond primary vortex in Jerusalem, Israel completely opened and activated
    and the seal on the third primary vortex/chakra began to open and acti-
    vate. The third vortex is located in the Himalayan Mountains of South
                        Central Asia. The Sphere of Amenti began transmitting its D-3 frequen-
     cies into Earth’s grid. The Keepers of the Blue and Violet Flames and their
    Flame Holders began the D-4 Solar-Heart Star Activation, initiating the
                        assembly and activation of their fourth DNA strand.  
             1 1 . June 24, 1996: Avatar 2—Eighth-level Avatar—Was Born And
                Aligned DNA  Strand 3 Imprint With 12-strand Pattern. Corrected
                   Strand 3 Imprint Begins Transmitting Through Earth’s Grid . The sec-
                   ond of six Silent Avatars was born. This avatar is a D-8 soul essence from
                   191  
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Opening the Halls of Amenti<br />
HU-3, an eighth-level avatar, with 8-dimensional frequency bands acti-
vated in his genetic code. This individual was born with the eighth DNA
strand fully activated. As his soul essence passed through the Sphere of
Amenti, the imprint for DNA  strand 3 was realigned with the 12-strand
DNA  pattern and the corrected third strand imprint began transmitting
through Earth’s grid.<br />
By 1996 there was great concern among Guardian races, as to whether
Earth’s grid speed would be raised high enough by 6/30/1998 to spark the sec-
ond seal on the Arc of the Covenant. If the second seal did not open by this
date, Earth could not begin its ascent into pulsation rhythms of the D-4 time
cycle for merger with Tara.<br />
If Earth’ s grid speed was not high enough to spark open the second Seal
on the Arc of the Covenant by June 30, 1998, the Bridge Zone Project would
not succeed. The Halls of Amenti would not open. The Earth would be
unable to shift into the D-4 time cycle by 1/2012 and the Dracos-Zeta Resis-
tance would have a much better chance of creating the 2003 experiment and
2004 Frequency Fence. If Earth was unable to begin shift into a D-4 particle
pulsation rhythm by 5/5/2000, sporadic Earth changes would erupt between
2012-2017, as the grids of Earth and Tara attempted to merge, and the oppor-
tunity for ascension would be lost.<br />
Guardians were permitted by the HU-2 and HU-3 councils to continue
their transmissions of D-4 frequency into Earth’s grid, but they were not per-
mitted to directly intervene in Earth’s affairs by landing and directing the
actions of humans to desired ends. Humans had been given guardianship of
Earth on 12/12/1994. Visiting Guardians were allowed to assist, but not to
alter the choices humanity would make for itself. The Dracos-Zeta Resistance
continued to inﬂuence human decision making through covert infiltrates,
and motivated an acceleration of new technology testing among various
groups of global military organizations. Top Secret military experiments using
scalar wave technology, satellite manipulation of inter-stellar radio waves and
certain types of nuclear testing from 1988 through the present, progressively
created new imbalances in Earth’s bio-fields and grid, which hampered the
Guardians’ efforts to raise grid speed. It was feared that by 6/30/1998 the grid
speed would not be high enough to spark the second seal on the Arc of the
Covenant. Guardian groups from all over the galaxy, and from HU-2 and
HU-3 watched, waited and prayed that humanity would be able to counter-
balance the activities of their governments by raising personal consciousness
and accretion levels enough to allow Earth’s grid speed to sufficiently
increase. In 12/1997 the Anunnaki Resistance began subliminally manipulat-
ing populations through the primary vortex in Jerusalem, the secondary vor-
tex in Manhattan and several other secondary vortices whose security seals
they were able to decode and release. Following this new development, the

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>odds of the second seal on the Arc of the Covenant sparking open by 6/30/
1998 were about two million to one against the event occurring.<br />
Prospects for the Bridge Zone Project and opening the Halls of Amenti were bleak as 1998
dawned under the in ﬂuence of covert ET manipulation<br />
THE ARC OF THE COVENANT OPENS<br />
In the beginning of this transmission we mentioned that we had an
announcement to make, and we will make that announcement now.
In February 1998 the Elohim from HU-3 knew the second seal of the
Arc of the Covenant would not be sparked open in time for the 6/30/1998
deadline. They broke their own protocol. Having a change of heart toward
helping the entire human species, rather than only their preferred genetic
strains, the Elohim intervened.<br />
The original ascension plan called for the birth of six avatar souls from
HU-3 and HU-4, between 1992 and 2012. These individuals were needed to
hold higher-dimensional frequency as Earth progressively integrated the fre-
quencies from the Sphere of Amenti and to correct any misalignments in the
morphogenetic imprints of DNA strands 2-7, within the Sphere of Amenti.
The avatars were to be born about four years apart, in various, undisclosed loca-
tions on the globe, beginning in 1992. Avatar 1 was born on 7/26/1992 and
Avatar 2 on 6/24/1996. Avatar 3 was not due to birth until the year 2000.
Knowing the ascension plan had reached a standstill early in 1998,<br />
the Elohim orchestrated the early birthing of the third avatar,<br />
the ninth-level avatar.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    With the birth of the third avatar, Earth’ s morphogenetic field would

<p>receive a sudden burst of UHF energy as the avatar soul passed through the

physical birth. ¹</p>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Most avatar souls do not enter the fetal body anywhere near conception, as the vibra-
tional rate of their consciousness would literally blow the physical tissue apart, cause mis-
carriage of the pregnancy and damage to the mother’s bio-energetic system. They usually
hover about and over shadow the pregnancy, then enter the infant’s body just before it
passes through the birth canal. Avatar pregnancies rarely exceed a seven-month gestation
period, as avatar-selected fetal bodies have a larger genetic package, tend to develop more
rapidly and begin to drain the life force energy of the mother-host after the seventh
month of gestation. Most are born as premature infants with soul integration taking place
during or just after the birth process.<br />

<p>Opening the Halls of Amenti<br />
The Guardian Alliance would like to announce the following:<br />
On June 26, 1998, at 3:46 PM, the third Avatar child was born, and the second
seal on the Arc of the Covenant sparked open, beginning Earth’s 2-year preparation
for passage into the particle pulsation rhythms of the D-4 time cycle.<br />
The child was born at home to a couple residing in a village of a Third
World country. He was in actuality a five5-month gestation infant, but is
believed to be only two-months premature. He is faring well and will survive
to ful fill his purpose of holding higher-dimensional frequency as the Sphere
of Amenti continues to open. The name, religious affiliation and location of
this child (and the other five avatars) are unimportant. His identity will not
be publicly disclosed, nor will the identities of the other five ascension ava-
tars reach public notice during the ascension period. Four of the Six Silent
Avatars will disclose their identities sometime after they have turned 33 years
of age and their service missions come into mass awareness.<br />
Anyone publicly claiming to be one of the six Silent A vatars before 2025
AD (when avatar one turns 33) is either misguided, being manipulated by
Intruder forces or is purposely trying to distort the truth. There are a number
of other legitimate avatars present on Earth at this time. Some of them are
publicly known, but these are not of the six Silent Ascension Avatars, whose
purpose is to realign the human DNA imprint and ensure Earth’s grid stabil-
ity by holding higher-dimensional frequency in their bio-energetic fields as
the Sphere of Amenti opens into Earths morphogenetic field.
Our announcement is thus a birth announcement, but also the con firma-
tion of Earth’s passage into the D-4 time cycle in preparation for entering the
Bridge Zone, the opening of the Halls of Amenti and the opportunity for
ascension.<br />
The second seal on the Arc of the Covenant has been sparked and Earth
will now begin preparation for the descent of the Blue Flame of Amenti and
the opening of the Halls of Amenti portals, which are scheduled for May 5,
2012.<br />
Your preparation for ascension is now back on schedule.</p>

<p>2012, the Palaidorians and Priests of Ur from HU-2, working with the Elohim

Zone project, and thus the ascension program, a minimum of 144,000 individu-
als on Earth would have to completely assemble and activate the sixth DNA
strand and rapidly begin assembly and activation of the seventh and eighth

<p>DNA strands. The only members of the human population on Earth that
organically possessed the sixth DNA strand imprint are the groups who have
undergone genetic acceleration through earlier Zionite intervention—those
who carry the Celestial 12-strand Silicate Matrix gene code. The Keepers of
the Blue, Violet and Orange-Gold Flames also possess this genetic con figura-
tion. The Sixth Root Race Muvarians and their Melchizedek Cloister race are
born with the fourth DNA strand assembled and the imprint for the fifth strand
dormant. The Muvarians have not yet begun their birthing cycle on Earth. The
Melchizedek Cloister race must fully assemble the fifth DNA strand before it
can activate the imprints for strands 6 and above. Members of all of these races
must fully assemble and activate the lower strands, then assemble and activate
the sixth strand by completing at least three Stellar-Star Crystal Activations,
before Earth can receive the needed concentration of D-6 frequency these acti-
vated sixth strand individuals would provide. There is little time left before the
2012—2017 ascension period begins for a minimum of 144,000 individuals to
awaken to their soul purposes and consciously complete these Stellar activa-
tions to activate their sixth DNA strand.<br />
Being aware of the shortage of time available to achieve the needed
sixth strand activations, the Palaidorians created an early birthing program
for members of the seventh Root Race Euanjhechi and their Cloister Race
Yunaseti. The Euanjhechi and Yunaseti, often referred to collectively as the
Paradisians,  possess a fully activated fifth DNA strand at birth and the ability
to rapidly assemble and activate the sixth DNA strand imprint, which they
organically carry. The Paradisians are D-6 soul essences and become fully
embodied souls when their sixth strand completes activation, usually by 12
years of age.<br />
Through soul agreements with members of the Sixth Race Melchizedek
Cloister and others carrying the Celestial Silicate Matrix gene code, 150,000
couples were chosen to serve as birthing parents for the incoming Paradisian
race soul essences. These are the only groups of humans possessing a large
enough gene code to create fetal bodies strong enough to hold the Paradisian
soul essence. Through these Palaidorian soul agreements, which are orches-
trated by the Priests of Ur from Agartha and Tara, selected Earth couples are
subconsciously guided together by their personal soul-level identities, to ful-
fill the Palaidorian Birthing Contract.<br />
Through astral contact and/or Guardian ET soul-agreement abductions,
the parent couples undergo manipulation of their bio-energetic fields and
DNA, to allow for a strong, energetic soul bond to be created between the
parents. This electromagnetic bond allows the soul matrices of the individu-
als in the couple to merge, forming an UHF bio-energetic field through
which an advanced fetal pattern, with a genetic code larger than that of
either of the parents, can be conceived. Once this bond, referred to as a

Bonding Contract  or Contract Bond,  takes place, the bio-energetic fields
and life paths of the parents are blended together, following which time the
couples will be led together through various circumstances that occur in their
earthly lives. Some of the parent couples will be consciously aware of these
Contract Bonds and Birthing Contracts, others will be consciously unaware
and “just so happen to fall in love with each other” and bear their Paradisian
child.<br />
The Palaidorian Birthing Contracts and Contract Bonds are high-level
soul agreements entered into by the parents’ over-soul level identities, in
cooperation with the over-soul identity of the child they will birth. In fulfill-
ing these contracts the individual parents receive acceleration of their
genetic blueprint, which allows them further advancement in their evolu-
tionary ascension process. The over-soul identity enters the Palaidorian con-
tract in order to allow its incarnate the opportunity for advancement. These
contracts in no way violate the rights of the incarnate and they are intended
by the over-soul to guide the incarnate to its highest life experience.<br />
The births of the Six Silent Ascension A vatars and those of the I50,000
Paradisian souls are orchestrated through Palaidorian Birthing Contracts and
Contract Bonds. The Paradisian souls will enter incarnation on Earth from
the D-6 frequency bands of Tara through the D-6 Sirian Stellar Spiral. The
sixth-dimensional frequencies correspond to the Indigo wave pattern of the
interdimensional Light Spectrum, thus the Paradisian children have been
nicknamed the “Indigo Children” or “Sirian Blue Babies”. The coming birth
of the Indigo Children has been foretold within various Earth human groups
that are working with other Guardian ET and metaterrestrial contacts. Some
of this information has been published in channeled writings.<br />
The birth schedule of the Indigo Children will proceed as follows: the
first wave of 144,500 Indigo Children will birth between 1999-2004. They
will complete activation of the sixth DNA strand at the age of 12, between
2011-2016. Children of the first birth wave will serve as Place Holders, their
sixth DNA strand activation serving to ensure the balance and grounding of
D-6 frequency on Earth during the 2012-2017 ascension period. The second
birth wave of 5,500 Indigo Children will birth between 2005-2017, to reach
maturity at age 12 between 2017-2029. The children of the second birth
wave will assist Bridge Zone Earth to balance frequency following the 2017
particle conversion process. They will also serve as Place Holders, grounding
D-6 frequency into the Sphere of Amenti race morphogenetic field.
The finalization of the Palaidorian Birthing Contracts and Contract
Bonds between the parent couples of the Indigo Children took place on
August 30, 1998. Prior to this date, contracts were transferable between vari-
ous eligible individuals, giving chosen soul identities the opportunity to exit
or renegotiate the terms of their Palaidorian Contracts.<br />

<p>Contracts and Contract Bonds, as the necessary bio-energetic field and DNA
adjustments that would ful fill the Contract Bond were given to the parent
couples through astral body mechanics, referred to as the Incubation Rite.
During the 3-day Incubation Rite, couples agreeing to uphold their contracts
were taken to Agartha-Inner Earth by the Priests of Ur, via their astral bod-
ies. The Priests of Ur then initiated the bio-energetic field mechanics
through which the DNA, bio-energetic fields and soul matrices of the two
individuals in a couple are fused together, by infusions of energy from their
respective over-souls.<br />
Through these rites, the Contract Bond and Birthing Contract are pro-
grammed into the individual’s active DNA program, creating a twin DNA
code alignment between the couple. This rite begins the Incubation Period
for each individual, through which the life patterns and soul directive of each
person is aligned with the contract and all events, karmic patterns and cir-
cumstances that are not part of the contract are purged from the life drama
manifestation pattern. From this point forward, the couple’s lives will unfold
according to the soul identity’s intentions, offering the incarnates protection
from various karmic dramas and ego-based choices that normally would have
manifested. The Incubation Rite marks the suspension of the karmic imprint
for the individual and the accelerated integration of the soul and ego identity.<br />
The couples of Palaidorian Birthing Contracts will begin rapid DNA
activation acceleration in preparation for their child’s birth, and will receive
“across the board” protection from the Palaidorians and HU-3 Guardians, to
ensure the success of their contracts. Though the families of the Palaidorian
Contracts may appear no different than any other Earthly family, they are
fully guided and protected from the higher Harmonic Universes. Due to their
agreement to participate in this service to human evolution, these couples
are granted direct intervention and support from the D-6 “Angelic King-
doms,” Guardians from HU-2 through HU-5 and the Entity gestalts from
Meta-Galactic Core. This “divine   intervention” will    create an  almost “magi-
cal” ease in Earthly endeavors that are part of the Palaidorian Contract and
the   individuals  will  also   experience  greater   difficulty   in   successfully   orches-
trating Earthly affairs that are not part of the contracts to which their souls
have agreed. All incarnates fulfilling their Palaidorian Birthing Contracts
will  be  freed  from the  HU-1 reincarnational cycles of   birth  and  death, follow-
ing their present incarnation.<br />
Through the births of the Six Silent A vatars and the Indigo Children,
Earth’s transition to the Bridge Zone and humanity’s opportunity for ascen-
sion will unfold as planned.<br />
12. June 26, 1998: Avatar 3—Ninth-level Avatar—Was Born Two Years
Early . The Second Seal On Arc Of The Covenant Opened. A vatar 3
Aligned DNA  Strand 4 With 12-strand Pattern. Corrected Strand 4
197</p>
<p>Opening the Halls of Amenti<br />
Imprint Will Allow Reverse-mutations Of Strand 4 Distortions; And
Release Of Palaidor, Amenti, And Zeta Seals From DNA On 5/5/2000.
The third of six Silent Avatars was born two years early via Elohim inter-
vention; originally birth was scheduled for 5/5/2000. This avatar is a D-9
soul essence from HU-3, a ninth-level avatar, with 9-dimensional fre-
quency bands activated in his genetic code. This individual was born with
DNA strand 9 fully activated. As his soul essence passed through the
Sphere of Amenti, the imprint for DNA strand 4 was realigned with the
12-strand pattern. The Seals of Palaidor, Amenti and Zeta all begin to
release with the assembly of the aligned fourth DNA strand. The birth of
Avatar 3 reset the aligned fourth strand pattern into the Sphere of Amenti
morphogenetic field, releasing the imprint of the Palaidorian, Amenti and
Zeta Seals from human DNA. The D-4 frequencies from Amenti will not
begin transmitting through Earth’s grid until 1/2000 and the corrected
pattern for the fourth DNA strand will begin transmitting through Earth’s
grid on 5/5/2000.<br />
