          <p>Chapter 4: Hidden Motives and Mechanics</p>
<p>Learning Dramas We have talked about the Zeta involved with humans at
this time who act in violation of universal law, which dictates
brotherhood and cooperation. You exist within a free-will universe and
because of this freedom there is much greater leeway of experience than
in other systems that operate upon a formatted structure of
predetermined action. But in a free-will zone there are also drawbacks,
from the perspective of security, conformity and “playing by the rules.”
There are “rules” in operation within all universal structures. These
“rules” serve as a primary set of agreements which allow for the
contours of a chosen reality to unfold into a platform upon which life
dramas (and the experiential learning they allow) can take place. In a
free-will zone one of the “rules” or base agreements is that
participants within that reality have the choice to “play by the rules”
or to ignore them, creating their own versions as they go along. The
rules within your particular system prescribe brotherhood, cooperation
and harmony between all portions of reality. But the rules also have
designed for you a polarized universe, where in all things exist within
a duality of perception. It is this feature of your system that allows
for the experience of “free will” to take place. Duality allows you the
choice of breaking the rules or following, of working with the flow of
natural evolution or against it. Each choice will provide for you a
consequence of action, or seemingly so from your focus of perception. In
greater terms each choice will show you a manifest translation of the
ideas you entertain. If those ideas move with the flow of evolution you
will experience a perceived state of ease, feelings of lightness and
pleasure and you will expand or grow into ever greater reality fields.
If you are moving against the flow of evolution you will experience the
opposite of these conditions; tension, heaviness, displeasure and
contraction, as you digress into ever smaller fields of reality and
identity. Both “paths” exist simultaneously; one implies the other. They
exist together as parts of a greater whole that is dimensional reality.
Your choices will determine experience while you are in a polarized
system, and thus you learn to make better choices. The Zeta who inflict
their experiments upon humans without consensual agreements from the
soul identity of the human are making a choice to move against the flow
of evolution, just as those humans who violate the free will and
birthrights of brotherhood of their co- inhabitants of Earth are
choosing to digress. Violation ultimately breeds the same, though the
“action/consequence” ratio may be spread out over time, where the
balance of universal law is not easy to detect. The Law of Reciprocity
or “What goes around comes around” is one of the rules within your
universe. It applies directly to all that you do and all that you
experience, but in your present state of evolution most of this
balancing takes place upon a subconscious level. Because of this many
things may seem “senseless” to you. You may witness violation of
yourself or others and wonder at the seeming unfairness of the universe
or “God.” Many of you view death as the ultimate victimization,
especially for those who appear to be victims of an untimely or unjust
demise. You are seeing the surface of events, and without knowing the
greater dramas those surface events are linked to it can often appear
that they are without cause or purpose. In viewing from the surface only
you may easily misunderstand the seeming “rules” (or lack of them) that
allow such apparent violations to take place. Three-dimensional reality
can seem quite threatening, unjust and chaotic when viewed from the
surface perceptions provided by your five known senses.4 This is an
illusion, very real from your perspective, that seems to be true because
the true justice, purpose, reason and order behind events, and the true
mechanisms of universal law, are hidden from your view. You do not have
“all of the puzzle pieces” to use an analogy, and so it is difficult to
“make sense out of the picture.” As your race evolves and its perceptual
range expands more “puzzle pieces” will be found, and as you grow you
will begin to see a very different picture of the universe than the one
you presently hold. You will discover the order behind the chaos, the
justice within the injustice and the reality behind the illusion. One
day you will come to master the experience of three- dimensional reality
and will no longer find yourselves trapped within its confines. But
until that time you are dealing with duality, free will, choice and the
responsibility of learning how to direct your choices wisely. The Zeta
and all others within the dimensionalized systems are learning these
basic lessons, in their own way and through their own path of
development. Learning can seem difficult when moving against the flow of
evolution, or it can be achieved with ease when moving within the flow.
Zeta and humans share many of the same lessons, and they will play,
within your three-dimensional drama, great teachers to each other and
will eventually learn the consequences of maneuvering within the
structures of universal law. The consequences can be a great delight or
they can seem quite treacherous. Either way learning takes place, and
that is why the soul awareness allows for consequences to be
experienced. When identity becomes integrated and the human (or other
biological being) grows to encompass the soul awareness the need for
treacherous outcomes declines. Souls, as groupings of identities, are
also learning and reaching for integration of the greater identity
structures of which they are a part. The greater the amount of
integration of awareness that takes place the less treachery is
experienced All life forms share a common goal of growth and expansion.
Impetus toward growth is one of the primary rules within your universe.
Growth into comprehension of the mechanics of brotherhood is a “rite of
passage” all will eventually pass through; when the interconnectedness
of all things is recognized as one of the basic universal laws the
cognition and practice of brotherhood will be achieved. Though the Zeta
generally are advanced in intellectual growth and technological
achievement compared to the human, many of them possess no greater
spiritual awareness than the average human of your time. Many Zeta fall
behind humans in regard to true spiritual cognition for they do not
possess the biological systems that allow for the characteristic you
call emotion. Emotion is far more than you realize. You use this term to
describe the perceived result of a subconscious process organic to your
form, but you rarely glimpse the reality of that process in energy
terms. Emotion is the “product” of the Seventh Sense, which can be
called “Cellular Absorption.” (We will detail the mechanics of this
sense in other writings). It is the ability, present on a cellular
level, to filter energy and frequency, create energetic imprints of that
filtered energy and translate the imprints into “packages of perception”
that are then used to feed information to the other senses. All body
mechanisms are regulated through this facility within the human
organism, and it allows for the development of tremendous potentials
within the human species. The Zeta biology is set up differently. As we
previously described the Zeta presently involved with your system are
mutations from their original form. That mutation occurred as a result
of their experiments in dimensional blending. Originally they did
possess a sense facility similar to that of the human emotive structure,
which allowed them greater freedom to connect with the universal
energy-grid structures that support the third dimension. With the
mutation they lost this ability. They became trapped within their own
biology and their soul identities became severed from the greater
structures from which they had been created. The Zeta were, in essence,
cut off from their central power source. Their species became
disconnected from the Soul Matrix. The Tree of Life All beings within
the dimensional systems enter those systems through a web work of
interconnected energy strands. There is a precise pattern to systems
entry, just as your computers have precise codes of access to their
operations. If you imagine the structural growth pattern of branches
upon trees you can get a rough visual representation of the energy web
work we describe. The tiniest bud is connected to the whole through a
system of intricate relays or branches. Nourishment is sent to the bud
via this pathway, replenishing and sustaining all of the many buds that
grow upon the tree. The energy web work of which the soul (and all of
its personalities) is a part can be compared to the network of branches
in the trees energy distribution system. Like the bud, the soul exists
as one expression or aspect of the greater network out of which it
grows. The personalities or incarnations of the soul can be compared to
the leaves emerging out of the bud. They are birthed, grow and die only
to be replenished and born anew within the next cycle of the seasons. As
the leaves exist as part of the tree, each taking up a different
placement in space but existing together simultaneously following the
cycle of the seasons, so too exist the personalities of the soul.
Viewing placement in time for the personality as you view placement in
space for the leaves and tree will help you to understand the nature of
time and identity. It will also help you to better understand your
distorted concept of reincarnation. Humans are connected to a soul that
exists as part of a greater network of life. We refer to the entire
network as the Energy Matrix. The “world within which the tree grows” in
our analogy. The tree in our analogy would represent in energy a
structure we call the Time Matrix. As the tree exists within a world,
the Time Matrix exists within the Energy Matrix. The leaves on our tree
exist within and emanate out of the bud, just as the personalities exist
within and emanate out of the soul. In our analogy the bud would
represent what we call the Soul Matrix or Dora Matrix. Just as the leaf
implies the existence of the bud and tree, the fact of your existence
implies the existence of a Soul Matrix and Energy Matrix System. The
Zeta are also part of such a “tree of identity.” Their species, like
your own would represent a bud upon a cosmic tree, in terms of our
analogy. We explained before how the Zeta inadvertently collapsed the
time portal system surrounding their home planet. You could compare
their portal structure to a branch on the tree. If a branch is
dismembered from the tree upon which it grows, not only will the branch
wither and die, but so will the buds and leaves that depended upon that
branch to transport nourishment and life force energy from the tree.
There is an intimate connection between the time portal system and the
genetic code of all life forms within it. When the time portals are
damaged the genetic imprint of biological life is altered, mutated from
its original pattern. When the Zeta disengaged their time portals from
the main grid of the Time Matrix it caused their mutation. Their biology
no longer carries the appropriate codes to allow them to link into their
Source. They lost the ability to experience emotion to a large degree,
and the emotional facility can be compared to the branch systems of our
tree. The Zeta are able to draw energy from their souls, but their souls
can no longer draw energy from the Time Matrix, Energy Matrix or Source.
Once the leaves fall the bud can no longer renew itself if it cannot
draw energy from the tree. The Zeta are as leaves and buds stunted upon
a withering branch that has been severed from the tree. A dying race
unless they are able to once again mutate their biological strain into
the Time Matrix and the Energy Matrix System. Through genetics they are
attempting to create what could be compared to a “splice,” taking their
fallen branch and reintroducing it to another tree in hope that the
“splice” will “take.” Their “home tree” exists within another “forest,”
an area in the galaxy they can no longer return to as the road of
transit has been destroyed. If you can understand a bit more about the
nature of your own reality and the Matrices we have mentioned you will
be more prepared to comprehend the plight of the Zeta and why they have
interest in your race. Perhaps you will be able to forgive them of their
violations against you if you can realize it is ignorance and
desperation that drive them to use methods that go against the flow of
evolution. Just as forgiveness and reeducation are the most appropriate
means to deal with fellow humans who cause others violation, so it is
too when considering the Zeta. Violation is caused by ignorance to
universal law, period! And its only true remedy is growth to awareness
and enlightenment. Some Zeta have grown to higher understanding working
with the aforementioned Aethien and other groups such as the Ranthia.
They have agreed to work in brotherhood under policies of nonviolation
and have committed to serving the flow of evolution, for all species,
not only their own. These enlightened Zeta are beginning to see how the
Law of Reciprocity operates. As they extended fairness, compassion and
the desire to cooperate with other forms of life, they found the same
gifts being extended on their behalf.</p>
<p>Guardian Intervention The Aethien and some other advanced
interdimensional races agreed to assist the Zeta in creating mutations
in their lineage through genetic engineering. Aethien are masters in
this regard and with the Zeta they created a plan that would serve the
good of all species involved. Previously the Zeta groups attempting to
form Zeta-human hybrids were aiming for a being that would function,
like humans, within the three- dimensional Earth system. If they were
successful in creating such a hybrid yet another species would be
entered into the Earth in competition for its resources. This plan was
bound to fail and create hardship for the Zeta, the humans and the Earth
itself. It would create a battle zone which was not in the best interest
of anyone involved. This plan would also create the disaster foretold by
your visionary Nostradamus. If the original Zeta plan had been allowed
to unfold you would have experienced your own version of “star wars,”
right upon your Earth. The visions of nuclear holocaust many of your
seers “picked up on” came from the future event in which the Zeta
invaded Earth because they felt the humans were not capable of working
cooperatively and there was no other option but to take the space and
resources they needed. This event would have indeed “marked the end of
time” as you know it. We have mentioned before that other intelligence
has been watching over your planet since its beginnings. The events of
the pending Zeta-human clash were observed by some of these groups as
the potential for that probable event moved closer to fulfillment. In
the mid 1980s a decision was made by the observers. It was agreed that
humans had shown enough growth toward brotherhood and had evolved to at
least a minimum degree wherein the scheduled event was worthy of outside
intervention. The “watchers” as we will call them, decided to help, as
many humans had requested this assistance. Humans who knew some of what
was brewing, knew that something dangerous was approaching. The watchers
set in motion an alternative plan, enlisting the help of the Aethien,
Ranthia, Ashtar and other groups. Some were assigned to helping the
humans accelerate their spiritual evolution so they would not react with
malice when encountering the Zeta. Others were assigned to assisting the
Zeta, and to finding other alternatives for them. The Aethien and the
Ranthia began to work closely with the Zeta. They formulated a plan in
which hybrids would be created using human genetic material but this
could only be done if the soul identity of the human was in agreement.
As the Zeta already possessed some abilities in multidimensional
acclimatization an environment better suited to their biology and needs
was found. An Earth existing within another dimensional band adjacent to
your Earth, but not within the third dimension, was chosen. Certain
adjustments would have to be made to the hybrid strain they were
developing so as to assist in its transplant to the new environment. The
Aethien knew how to orchestrate these alterations. So with the help of
numerous groups the Zeta agenda was shifted away from the pending
holocaust and toward a peaceful, co-creative, cooperative plan that
would open new options for growth for both the human and Zeta lineage.
Humans do not presently realize what great times are upon them, nor do
they comprehend the scope or meaning of the tragedy they just barely
avoided. You, as humans, do not yet realize what gratitude is in order.
The majority of Zeta in your system now work toward brotherhood, and
with the Aethien, Ranthia and others offer whatever assistance they can
to humans on the quest of enlightenment. Most Zeta can be trusted, but
it is difficult for them to convey this sentiment to those humans they
interact with because they are so often met with fear, anger and violent
reactions due to human misunderstanding. Even though most Zeta can now
be trusted in their dealings with humans, there are certain factions of
the race who have not yet agreed to the new agenda. We refer to these
factions simply as the “unenlightened Zeta.” The unenlightened ones are
those responsible for numerous abductions in which pain was caused to
the human; not merely frightening encounters and mild testing, but
actual physical or mental harm. We are not happy to inform you that
quite a few of your mentally ill population became impaired as a result
of the activities of the unenlightened groups. Because soul agreements
are not involved in such abductions the Zeta responsible had little clue
as to what tactics were useful, and what was harmful. They experimented
randomly, such as your scientists do with laboratory rats.  Some of your
“missing persons” cases are also caused by these intrusions. For a time
the unenlightened ones did not comprehend the genetic orientation of the
human, and did not know of the aforementioned Silicate Matrix within
some of the populace. They assumed that all humans could undergo
dimensional transmigration. Numerous subjects were lost in attempting to
transport them into craft stationed beyond the third-dimensional
frequencies. Some were actually lost in time, thrown into the past or
future of your time continuum, because the relationships between the
time portals and the human genetic structure were not understood by
these groups. Certain cases (but not all) of “spontaneous combustion”
reported in your present time occurred at the hands of Zeta, abduction
attempts that “went wrong.” These travesties took place (and still
occasionally do) because of Zeta ignorance to the human structure, and
because no attempt was made by them to contact the soul identities of
the human subjects. Like many humans, many Zeta do not understand the
reality of their connection to soul, and because they do not comprehend
this reality in themselves they do not validate it within other life
forms. The enlightened Zeta are learning of these things from the
Aethien and Ranthia. Those who are willing to learn, and there are many,
are being trained in contact procedures that do not violate the
integrity of the human subjects. The groups who are working toward
brotherhood can be easily identified as there will always be among them
the Aethien, Ranthian (who sometimes take on human guise during working
with humans) or Zionite (as previously discussed) guardians, serving as
hosts, advisors, teachers, healers or in positions of command. It is
important that humans become aware of the Zeta presence, and learn to
distinguish between the enlightened groups and those that may bring them
harm. One tactic of differentiation that is useful during abduction
encounters is that of holding in mind (Zeta can see your mental
pictures) the image of one of the guardian races (see Guardian images,
page lviii). If you are dealing with an enlightened Zeta you will be
greeted with a response of curiosity and positive acknowledgment. If it
is an unenlightened Zeta the reaction will be one of tension and a
“hands-off” stance, as the Zeta who are aware of the guardians and have
chosen not to cooperate are intimidated by them. When dealing with Zeta
who do not know of these overseers, you may still hold the image in mind
and request assistance. Zeta still have a strong link to the collective
Zeta mind. Though they now operate independently you can still reach the
collective by projecting your thoughts through one of its individual
members. The impression will be picked up by one of the helping groups
if it is strong enough. Zeta manipulate through the mind, and humans
must learn to do “mind-to-mind combat” and to redirect the harmful Zeta
rather than attempt to destroy them. They cannot be fought successfully
by humans, but they can be redirected to haggling it out with their own
kind. The enlightened Zeta and the groups working with them are the
humans best allies in protecting themselves from the harmful Zeta. The
enlightened groups are doing the best they can to redirect their strayed
brethren to the new benign agenda. Humans engaged in encounters with the
tormentors are urged to assist in this redirection. Reactions of fear,
anger and panic will do nothing to protect you, but staying centered in
your own identity with the intention of redirecting the abductors will
prove well worth your while. In helping yourself you will be helping
others also, a universal law in operation. Humans are being called upon
to pass on this vision of hope to those who need it most—the abductors
who have yet to learn the wisdom of co-creative brotherhood—and their
fellow humans who are learning the same lessons.</p>
<p>Zeta Conspiracy The Zeta following the old agenda believe themselves to
be desperate. They are weakening—their bodies and abilities are
failing. Though the majority of Zeta have transferred to the new agenda
there are still several hundred thousand following the old plan, both in
your dimension and in those surrounding it. Collectively they still
represent quite a force, a force that can impact your future adversely
if it is allowed to go unchecked. They are presently trying to
orchestrate, through the workings of your Interior Government
(previously discussed), a travesty upon your species. The humans
involved in this scheme are blinded by the pursuit of power and
domination. And it is because of their involvement and willing
participation that the old agenda still looms as a potential threat to
your system. Though much assistance is being offered to your species
from the guardian races the events you encounter will still be the
consequences of your choices, individually and collectively.  How many
of your numbers will blindly follow the dictates of leadership, a
leadership that unknowingly grows more and more influenced by the
presence of the Interior Government? How many will have the courage and
ability to poke their heads above the programming enough to begin asking
the right questions? How many will dare to believe stories such as this,
that challenge everything the program has taught you to believe? How
many humans will embrace the value of their personal essence and follow
it into spiritual awakening? The answers to these questions will
determine what reality awaits you as you proceed into the 21st Century.
Presently your Interior Government thinks it is manipulating the Zeta
(it has been working with them on the old agenda for several decades).
These humans have as their human agenda a quest for world power. These
humans think nothing of betraying their own people (as they have done in
the past and continue to do), seeing “lesser” humans (in their minds) as
expendable resources and Zeta as tools through which they can bring
about their plan of global dominion. You would be frightened if we told
you of some of the things that have been and are presently being done.
Many of you would not believe us so conditioned have you become to
unthinkingly accepting what “authorities and experts” tell you. Choosing
to think and question is a choice, and like its opposite, will have
consequences. The Interior Government factions plan to continue to
“cooperate” with the Zeta, allowing them to take what they desire from
the human populace in return for technological and genetic advancements
(this group of humans would love to “live forever,” since they have
little true spiritual comprehension—death is viewed as their greatest
defeat. They are nearly obsessed with techniques, genetic or otherwise,
that will prolong life span and deter biological deterioration.
Advantages they are seeking to horde for themselves, of course.) They
employ UFO debunking and witness character assassination tactics, (and
occasionally witness assassination) to provide a cloak of secrecy for
the Zeta following the old agenda. They are dangerous people, (as our
translator may find when our books begin to circulate), with many
resources, but they are a minority. There is no safety in blindness,
only blindness. Safety comes from awareness and making appropriate
choices, informed choices, and that is precisely what the Interior
Government does not want the masses to be capable of doing. They prefer
to keep you distracted, and will create all sorts of political,
economic, and environmental strategies aimed at fueling controversy,
internal conflict and other preoccupations so the public does not have
time or energy to notice that information on many things is being
withheld and misrepresented. Be aware of the tactics being used, for
they are employed to sidetrack you from the covert agenda that will
affect every one of you more than you know. Does availability of money
affect you? Does personal security for yourself and loved ones affect
you? Does your biological and psychological health affect you? For these
are the specific areas through which they plan to manipulate you on a
mass level. The old agenda is much larger than you suspect, and it has
been progressively employed in stages. This plan is still being carried
out by those involved. On the surface you may see “still waters,” or
perhaps a little ripple here and there just so things look natural
enough, but did you ever think of what might lurk within the murky
depths of the collective world government infrastructure? You have
probably been too busy with “more important things,” just as you have
been programmed to be. The Interior Government has approximately 100,000
key members globally at the time of this writing—no small enterprise.
We are referring here to its human members. Many others are involved but
do not consciously know what they are submerged within. Once in, members
rarely get out…alive. This may sound like some sort of plot from a
communist regime, but it is in operation beneath the democracies of the
world also. At least within the dictatorships the common people know
they are not free and can make their choices accordingly. But in the
democracies of the world the people believe in the freedoms provided by
their constitutions and judicial systems. They believe they are free,
and in one sense they are—free from knowing that they are being
compromised by an Interior Elite. Free from knowing what they are being
subjected to at the hands of these hidden directors. Free to think that
they alone are controlling their own destiny as they struggle to evolve
within the status quo. Who do you think would benefit the most from
having the public believe that UFOs were hoaxes and aliens imaginary?
The public? Do you really think your national or personal security is
being protected by having the public kept in the dark about the fact
that humans are not the only or most intelligent form of life in the
universe?  Wouldn’t you rather know the truth? Why do you think the
truth is being kept from you? Who would benefit most? Questions you
might choose to ponder if you ever have time for such things. These
statements may anger many of you, those of you who love your free
countries and the liberties they stand for. It would reduce you to tears
if you knew the truth of what goes on behind the back of your official
governments. So preoccupied are your people with the surface issues that
few look deep enough or far enough to begin to see the scheming that
takes place “underground and behind closed doors.” Those who get close
often “disappear,” meet with a “terrible accident” or decide to
conveniently “kill themselves.” We are not joking. We are not
exaggerating. Does this sound like democracy to you? In our opinion it
is an indignity to the concept and a desecration to the good- hearted
people who would put their lives on the line to uphold their country’s
virtue. And so we tell you of some of the truths you may not want to
hear. Now we will tell you more; for those who desire to understand. The
Interior Government plans to use the Zeta they pretend to co-operate
with for their technology and knowledge, and when they feel confident
enough in using these new acquisitions they plan to overpower the Zeta
in their weakened condition. Then they hope to further implement their
plans of directing and controlling global resources. The Zeta, however,
are far better at this game of strategic manipulation, and have been
covertly manipulating the human element within the Interior Government
since the beginning of their involvement.</p>
<p>Holographic Inserts One type of technology that is presently being
shared by the Zeta is the artificial creation through mechanical means
of Holographic Inserts (See page 27). (Zeta are able to initiate this
tactic using mental applications and without mechanical devices. They
have not divulged these methods to the humans but instead convinced them
that human biology was not equipped to create that level of
implementation, which is only partially true.) This covert Zeta and
human team is planning to utilize this technology to manipulate and
direct large masses of people. And they are orchestrating it in a way
that will “hit home” with the gentlest of souls. Holographic Inserts
depicting religious personages and dramas have already been employed in
small doses, as test runs for the greater applications. Faking
“miracles,” appearances of saints and holy ones, the return of deceased
loved ones, all of these personally sacred subjects are fair game to the
exploitation of holographic inserts. Plans are in the making to stage
dramas using the traditional as well as “new age” belief systems. True
“miracles,” and visitations will also be occurring as this century
closes and will continue well into the next. How will you know which
events are real and which events are being manufactured to manipulate
the populace? How will you know who or what to believe when you won’t
even be able to fully trust what your five senses are telling you? Is
there a way to detect a holographic insert or to protect yourself from
being victimized by them? We will address these questions and more in
the following sections. If our perspective seems radical to you,
upsetting and unsettling, we apologize. It is hoped that you can
understand the concern and indignation on your behalf from which we
speak. There are many beings, both human and otherwise willing and able
to assist you in your growth and spiritual development. There are many
positive agendas taking place within your external government,
scientific and religious communities that provide needed assistance,
growth opportunities and support to the public. And there is a wealth of
kind-hearted, just, spiritually aware people throughout your world whose
dedication, love and wisdom serve to uplift and inspire your species
toward fulfillment of its vision of brotherhood. These positive forces,
combined with a treasury of support “behind the scenes” from within the
multidimensional and multi-universal systems, continue to move humanity
forward in its evolution despite the efforts of the Interior Forces to
thwart them. You are progressing well in your development toward
enlightenment, and we commend you. If we did not fully believe that
humans were capable of fulfilling the role for which they were created,
the role of Earth guardian and conscious co-creators of reality, we
would not labor to bring you information you will need in your journey
to success. Unlike those who attempt to hold you back, we do not
underestimate your intelligence, your fortitude and your ability to
become responsible for the direction in which your destiny unfolds. We
believe in your innate goodness and honor you for the noble beings that,
in truth, you are. Let us remind you of that nobility so that you may
rediscover the beauty of your race and allow that beauty to burst forth
into the universe renewing all that it touches. May you, yourselves, be
renewed in resurrecting the majesty of your multidimensional being. Next
we will explore the current Interior agenda of holographic inserts and
how these will be used in an attempt to direct you away from the truth
and integrity that live within you.</p>
<p>Frequency Fences The technology of the holographic insert holds great
promise for furthering the development of your species. This ability,
even if it was mechanically created would revolutionize every aspect of
your society. It would also begin to open your abilities to traverse
your localized time portal system. The Zeta have not provided the data
necessary for the time portals to be activated. They do not want the
Interior Government or any other humans to have access to a working
knowledge of these systems. Instead they have provided some information
to the Interior forces, to appease them, but this data is distorted and
incomplete. So the Interior as well as the exterior scientific
communities still struggle with “sending things back in time” and
“making them disappear” (Some progress has been made in the case of the
latter). The Zeta are utilizing the Interior’s greed for power. They are
helping to orchestrate the utilization of holographic inserts on large
masses of people. Though the Interior Government thinks the Zeta are
assisting them to put in place certain mass “frequency control devices”
that will eventually have the power to “scramble” selected human brain
wave patterns, thereby blocking out frequencies coming from sources
outside of government control (such as those transmitted by ET and other
dimensional groups, and also the frequency patterns emanating from the
personal and collective Soul Matrix) but the Zeta are in actuality
working toward orchestration of a different plan. Zeta are helping to
create this “frequency fence” but not in order to assist the Interior
Government in creating a docile and obedient populace. The Interior
desires to control the mental and emotional forces within the populace
in order to use individuals and masses to do their bidding. They are
interested in creating a form of “Super Soldier” that will be able to
easily neutralize simple human armies. By setting itself up as the
“Invisible Big Brother” they will not only be able to horde and control
the distribution of Earth’s resources, but they hope to be able to
“explore and conquer” new territories once the time portal codes are
activated. Their purpose is to plunder for personal gain and for the
“thrill of the kill” in bringing others under their dominion. Other
abusive forces that do exist within the universe watch them with
amusement, as the Interior is playing right into their hands. As the
Interior moves silently forward with its plan of dominion their Zeta
“helpers” are using them to help fulfill their personal agenda. The
Interior is more concerned with keeping people distracted, fragmented
and confused, so they do not notice that their freedom is being stolen
out from under them. The unenlightened Zeta have something else in mind.
These factions of the Zeta race, resigning themselves to the probability
that they would reach extinction before finding a way to return to their
own planet and time continuum decided to opt for the “next best
solution.” If they could cultivate hybrids acclimated to the Earth
environment they would be able to repopulate the planet. There is one
small obstacle in the way of this plan, however —the presence of the
human race. Other species could easily be dominated and integrated into
a Zeta regulated society. But humans will not be easy to subdue, and the
Zeta know this. The Zeta acknowledge their present dependence upon the
species for the provision of genetic material. They have a plan of
segregating the global population into those possessing desirable
genetic qualities and those who do not have qualities they care to
reproduce. The humans chosen as breeders would be utilized to create a
work force to supply Zeta needs and the “best among them” genetically
would be used to create various strains of hybrid beings to strengthen
and re-colonize their settlement on Earth Humans presently do not have
the power to successfully ward off the Zeta through force. The planet
would be plundered in the attempt to do so. Humans greatest defense is
becoming aware of what is taking place and uniting their energies with
those willing to assist in the name of universal brotherhood. The
renegade Zeta must not be permitted to fulfill their plan. Though this
plan is still in its early stages within your three-dimensional Earth
system, this is not the case in several parallel and adjacent systems.
One adjacent system in particular has been fully infiltrated and those
controlling that reality have their sights set upon expanding into your
three-dimensional Earth system at a time coordinate that exists within
your future. Humans that enjoy their present levels of freedom within
the democracies of Earth and those who believe in the liberties of a
free society had best take heed of the events now occurring within that
adjacent system as the groundwork for its interception is presently
being set within your global community by the Interior Government
forces. We will elaborate upon this adjacent Earth system in sections to
follow, but for now we will return to our discussion of holographic
inserts and how they are presently being used to direct the perceptions
of your people. Previously we mentioned that holographic inserts using
themes popular within your traditions were being used in “test runs” of
the project. Most of these tests were orchestrated using individuals or
small groups of people, in which scenarios pertinent to these subjects
were created and the emotional reaction patterns of the participants
were studied. Attention is paid to perceptual range of the human subject
as the Zeta are aware that are great variations among the populace in
regard to perceptual ability. They are attempting to find a consensual
mean of frequency through which they can broadcast the holograms and
hope to use the frequency fence to block out frequency bands that do not
fall within that average range. In this way large masses of people can
be “tuned into” the particular range of the holographic insert and
blocked from receiving frequency that would create sense data that was
in contradiction to the illusion of the insert. The inserts are being
designed to engage the emotional facilities of the human. Themes deeply
engraved within the minds of the people are being contrived into
distorted interpretations of events that have basis in reality for the
subjects. As Zeta have time portal access they have been able to monitor
some of the activities of the other ET, interdimensional and guardian
groups who are planning to create encounters with humans for purposes of
helping the populations to grow and evolve successfully. Though the Zeta
will not be able to stop these helping groups, or halt the
implementation of the events they plan to create, they are able to scan
the intended events and create distorted versions of them through the
holographic inserts. Over the next twenty years alignments of certain
key time portal structures are occurring, following the cycle intrinsic
to your planetary placement within the galactic grid. These alignments
make it easier for data to be entered into your system from other times
and other dimensions. Many of the helping groups intend to use this
opportunity to introduce new information and technologies that will
assist in the evolution of your species. The Zeta and the Interior are
aware of this and they do not want this information to be made available
to the masses as it is intended. They are planning now to “raid” certain
of the positive agendas creating misleading holographic inserts that
will direct the perceptions and thoughts of the populace away from the
applications of the positive agendas. The Zeta are using images,
scenarios and personages held sacred to the traditional religions to
divert the people into submission, subservience and blind obedience to
the official and covert governments. Philosophies that rely upon
congregational following of authorities, in which people are taught to
trust the leaders interpretation of spirituality above their own
spiritual comprehension (a practice coloring most of the world’s
traditional religions), are primary targets for manipulation using
holographic inserts. The Christian and Jewish faiths, along with some
Eastern practices and traditions popular within the South American
continent have been singled out as primary testing grounds for the
implementation of holographic inserts on a mass level. People who
blindly follow the dictates of these traditions and those who lead them
are especially vulnerable to holographic manipulation. David Koresh and
the Waco, Texas, Branch Davidians and Marshall Applewhite and the
Heaven’s Gate group are two such organizations that have been
manipulated by the unenlightened Zeta through holographic insert
technology. The inserts have been and will be used to lead people away
from the true divinity that lives within them and from any true
spiritual connection. The desired result of this manipulation is to
sever the actual energetic connection of the individual to the personal
Soul Matrix and reconnect the individual to a “group mind” network
existing within another dimensional structure. The Zeta are well aware
of the multidimensional operation of the Collective Mind as their own
species existed for centuries under such a structure. Though the
mechanics of this endeavor are complex, the concept is simple. All
people exist as individualized embodiments of a greater energetic
identity. This greater identity can be viewed as the portion of their
conscious awareness that is too large in energy volume to “fit into” the
limited confines of the body structure. The body, and the consciousness
focused within it exist within this greater pool of energy, and it is
this energy that creates the body, sets the autonomic body processes,
and continually feeds the body life force energy. There are certain
structures that link the body, mind and emotions to this Soul Matrix of
energy. (See Error: Reference source not found.) It is possible, for
those who understand how to manipulate the subtle energy bodies, to
“splice” an individual from one Soul Matrix into another matrix, and
disconnect the bio-energetic circuitry from the original soul. This
process can be used to assist individuals under certain conditions, but
it can also be used to disable them from connecting with their greater
identity and innate spiritual connection. When used in negative
applications you could view this process as “soul robbing,” as the
physical embodiment is “stolen” from its original Soul Matrix. This is
precisely what the Zeta have in mind as part of their agenda. By linking
those selected from the human populace into a “false matrix:” (part of
the original Zeta Collective Mind Matrix), humans would be easily
controlled as the false matrix would continually sustain certain
holographic inserts making them appear as “permanent” features of
reality. Any sensually illusional reality could be sustained in such a
way, and the humans involved would have no idea or memory indicating
that anything was out of order. As the individual becomes disconnected
from its original soul matrix all memory contained within its DNA and
cellular pattern is wiped away, as it is the Soul Matrix that acts as
the programming device and storage house for human memory. When the
human is fully connected to the false matrix, the original connection to
the soul can then be disengaged, and the new matrix will program the DNA
and “download” the “memories” purposely programmed into the false
matrix. At this point in the process there would be a brief lapse of all
memory, and a minor disability in short term memory functions, while the
cellular code begins to process its new set of instructions. There may
be trace memories from the “original soul program” that arise to
awareness in “ghost image” form, which will occasionally create severe
mental disturbances for the human subject. Pieces of memory from the old
program may emerge spontaneously from cellular residue and interface
with the operational “instructions” from the new program, distorting the
electrical impulse patterns to the brain, as well as the chemical
balances of the human biology.  In severe cases the individual will be
unable to hold a consistent present-moment focus in time, and will “flip
back and forth” between a multitude of “identity fragments” that
represent pieces of memory from both residual traces of the old Soul
Matrix (not only memory bits from the individual but also from the
entire bank of identities stored in the Soul Matrix) and fragmented
pieces of the new program and the entire contents of the Zeta Collective
false matrix. The human biology is not designed to assimilate such an
onslaught of inconsistent electrical data and will be biologically
unable to process the memory fragments into a coherent focus of identity
in time. Should the unenlightened Zeta plan from the old agenda reach
fulfillment your populace would literally be robbed of its individual
and collective memory, creating “biological puppets” that the Zeta could
program in any way they choose. In this way they will be able to take
advantage of certain “desirable” strains of humans while easily
controlling them by directing the contours of their individual and mass
identities. The complexity of orchestrating a “mental takeover” on a
species level is vast, but it has been done before at different times
within all of the dimensions. The aftermath of such a project is always
disastrous in the long run, for the planet and local galactic structure
as well as for the life forms existing within those systems. There are
areas within the intergalactic and multidimensional grid that at
different times have literally been blown out of the grid and cut off
from the reality fields of which they were a part. Like humans and other
biological individuals, planets and galaxies also possess a Soul Matrix,
of which the Soul Matrices of all the systems inhabitants are a part.
All of these grids or matrices are created through and connected to the
Time Matrix. (Error: Reference source not found) The Time Matrix is the
energy distribution system which carries life force energy from Source
into the dimensional systems. When a planet or galaxy is “blown out of
the grid” of its Soul Matrix, which directly connects it to the Time
Matrix and thus perpetual energy supply, its energy and its evolutionary
potentials become finite. The system falls into digression, and as its
finite energy quotient is expended the system has no way to replenish
its supply. The existing energy is recycled within the system, but will
eventually become negated as the recycling continually reduces the
“thrust” or power contained within its particles. The matter forms
within such a system deplete, atrophy and eventually (sometimes over
hundreds of thousands of years) implode, their “blueprint” (and thus the
possibility of regeneration or replication) fragmented into unorganized
units of energy and consciousness. This fragmented energy is the state
of being indicated by your concept of oblivion. It is the condition your
religious concept of Hades or Hell was intended to depict, in symbolic
form. (Your concept of Purgatory describes the experience of living
within a system that was cut off from the grid, before its pending
implosion. It has also been used to indicate the state of being for the
personality who has become severed from its own Soul Matrix.)</p>
<p>Zeta Planet Destruction All within the Time Matrix grid is
interconnected, and when a planet or galaxy is blown off the grid a hole
is left within the grid “fabric.” This hole affects everything within
the area of activity surrounding the hole, as energy flowing around the
broken grid lines hits “blank spots” or breaks in the pattern. The grid
lines within the Time Matrix represent Time Continua, or “passageways of
linear time sequencing.” When energy approaches the hole in the fabric
of the Time Matrix it is magnetically pulled into the hole. Once it
enters the hole the time sequence organization that it originally
carried as part of the Time Matrix becomes scrambled and the energy is
no longer able to reenter the Time Matrix from the position in which it
first entered the hole. This “energy” can take the form of an individual
in biological form, a personal Soul Matrix or “soul,” a planet or galaxy
or the entire galactic Soul Matrix. When one element from within a given
time continuum enters the hole, its own sequential program will serve as
a “beacon” for all other energies possessing that particular coding.
This beacon not only “broadcasts” its signal back into the Time Matrix
through its electrical particles (which act as transmitters) but it also
begins to draw in like energy through its magnetic particles (which act
as magnetic receivers). The element lost within the hole then pulls in
more and more energy from its home system. The “holes” we are referring
to are, of course, the phenomena you describe as Black Holes. As
described in previous sections, the Zeta originally entered your system
as they searched for solutions involving conditions that occurred upon
their own planet, Apaxein Lau. The “conditions” the Zeta hoped to remedy
are precisely those described above. Through their experimentation with
dimensional frequency blending they created a situation in which a
minute hole was ripped into the “frequency pattern” of the regions
involved in the dimensional merge. The intended merger of dimensional
fields was not successful as the hole would not allow the area of
frequency blending to stabilize into a consistent particle code pattern
that would allow for a stable linear time sequence to take hold. The
blended-dimension reality field was kept open for several hundred years
before the Zeta became aware of the hole. A great amount of energy from
this blended region “fell into” the hole and systematically pulled in
more and more energy. Black Holes will pull in first those forms that
possess energy coding that is consistent with the coding of the
particles that exist at the site of the hole. That is, the items to
first disappear are those who’s particle structures are in the
continuum, or “grid strand,” where the break in pattern has occurred. In
the Zeta incident this particle compatibility emerged within certain
elemental components of the outer atmosphere of their home planet. Over
centuries there became an obvious depletion of this elemental component
within their atmosphere, which is what led the Zeta to suspect that
there was a problem with their dimensional blending project. The hole
was finally located and identified by observing the rate and form of
depletion of controlled samples of the outer atmosphere. The depletion
rate was accelerated when the samples were placed in various locations
upon the planet. They were able to pinpoint the hole by observing
particle movement and “following the path” of accelerated particle
depletion for the element in question. They were able to “follow the
beacons” emitted by the particles within the hole but only to a certain
point at which the beacons (minute electrical emissions) would
disappear. It took several generations to discover that these particles
were pulling in an exponentially expansive quantity of matter. The
particles would disappear as the “scrambling” of their base time code
structure occurred. The original code was unraveled, its elements
disbursed within the reality fields of the black hole. The Zeta realized
that this condition was a result of the dimensional blend, and so they
hoped that by “undoing” the blend and closing the mediation zone between
the dimensional portals that had been forced open, that they could
effectively disengage the black hole. What they did not realize is that
once a hole is created it will continue to exist until all energy that
passed through it is reclaimed and restored to its original time
sequence organization. They were able to close the mediation zone
effectively, and when they observed the area where the hole had been the
hole was no longer there. The Zeta assumed that they had closed the hole
when they closed the mediation zone territories in which it had existed.
This was not the case. The mediation zone had been created by merging
certain frequency patterns of the third- dimensional and other
dimensional versions of their planet. The frequency patterns of each
were “bent” slightly until they came into range of each other. Then an
artificial “frequency splice” was added to serve as a bridge between the
two frequency bands. This bridge forced open an existing dimensional
portal and kept it open as long as the bridge was in place (this is a
manipulation process that goes against universal law, as it throws the
entire time cycle of which it is a part out of synchronization with the
Time Matrix). The black hole was still encoded within the frequency
patterns of both dimensions, and when the bridge was closed the hole
pattern fragmented, changing location within the outer atmosphere of
both planets. Again it took generations to rediscover the continued
existence and new location of the hole, and by this time the genetic
mutations that this project had initiated began to show themselves.
Knowing that the hole was responsible for their declining species, they
hoped to retrieve and reorganize the lost energies so as to reverse the
genetic mutation and restore health to their species. Though they had
the technology to seal off the hole and stop it from pulling energy,
they did not do this because the hope of reversing the mutation was
within retrieving the energy from the hole and permanently closing the
structure. The Zeta could no longer reside within their planet’s
atmosphere and so they decided to evacuate and temporarily relocate to
another planet within an adjacent dimension to their own, where they
could continue with the project of retrieving the energies from the
hole. They had not planned on anyone “raiding their project,” but that
is what took place. Other, more advanced groups within the surrounding
galaxy knew the danger of keeping the black hole opened. It was pulling
energy at an alarming rate and posed a serious threat to the entire Time
Matrix coordinate that was home to the Zeta and many others. The black
hole was sealed, a process which took time, and accelerated its
magnetism. The Zeta home planet and it dimensional counterpart were
“sucked in,” leaving only a small portion of the planetary Soul Matrix
behind within the Time Matrix. It is through this event that the Zeta
became trapped within your system, and the others to which it had
migrated. Literally homeless and rapidly declining, they had no choice
but to seek other solutions. We hope that this little story about the
Zeta will serve as education to your scientists who play with small
particle mechanics before they have the knowledge to understand the
consequences of their actions.</p>
<p>Holographic Inserts and Matrix Transplantation Now we will resume our
discussion about the Zeta plan to use holographic inserts and matrix
transplantation to orchestrate a “mental takeover” of the human species.
When a “soul robbery” or forced matrix transplant occurs (when the human
is removed from its connection to its organic Soul Matrix and connected
to another, for example) the “cord” of energy that once connected the
human to the Soul Matrix is “left hanging,” so to speak. This cord spews
energy from the Soul Matrix, just as your finger would spew blood if the
tip was severed. If this energy leakage is not stopped the Soul Matrix
itself would become depleted, as well as the energy structures that feed
it, and a large buildup of energy would occur within the planetary grid.
This energy buildup would follow the path of the particles carrying its
code. The human who had been “transplanted” to another matrix structure
would be natural receiver of this energy. As the biological structure of
the human is “close circuited” into the new matrix, the energy would
then be drawn into the other dimensional Earth version, or “parallel
universe,” and to the individual residing in that system who represents
the implied counterpart to the human living within your system. We will
not go into the mechanics of universal physics in this transmission, so
it is enough that we say here that you have a “reflection,” “double,” or
“doppleganger” (as some in your system call it), residing within a
parallel system, that represents the “antiparticle” to your “particle.”
This double is often called the “light body” in your times, or sometimes
the “shadow.” Both terms can be misleading so we will use the
terminology with which we are familiar. We refer to the double as the
Dolar Imprint or Dolus for short. In other writings we will elaborate
upon the Dolus and its counterpart. For now, what you need to know to
follow our discussion is that the Dolus will be the recipient of that
“spewing” energy from the forced matrix transplant. This errant energy
will emerge within a portion of the double’s “subtle energy bodies.”
Humans (and other biological organisms) are connected to the Soul Matrix
by “strands” or “cords” of energy. The cord runs from the core unit of
identity for that person as held within the Soul Matrix, and extends
outward to a “sac” at its end. Some in your time refer to this sac as
the “tissue capsule”; we call it the Nadial Capsule or the Nadis. The
Nadis is a literal “sac” of energy that surrounds your physical body. It
contains all of the life force energy you will use in one lifetime as a
single incarnation in time and space. The process of growth, in your
terms, is the process of bringing the energies from within the Nadis
through into the biological form, thus expanding that form. As energy
leaves the Nadis and enters into the body it must first pass through the
two inner layers of the Nadis. These inner nadial structures are known
in your time as the Mental and Emotional Bodies, and they give to you
the qualities of being you know as mental awareness, or “thinking,” and
emotional cognition, or “feeling.”5 The errant energies spewing from the
severed cord are rechanneled into the Dolus, (other dimensional double)
through its center point. (The excess energy stimulates the opening of
the center point within the Dolus). These energies then become a part of
the “subtle energy bodies” of the double, first entering the mental area
then filtering into the emotional body. If the physical body of the
double does not rapidly expand (which it cannot do if blocks in the
mental body are present) to accommodate the new energy this energy will
build up within the emotional body of the double as erratic electrical
impulse which will throw the emotional balance “out of whack” and with
it the chemical and hormonal balances within the physical body. If left
unchecked this condition will cause acceleration of the aging process as
the erratic patterns block the clear flow of energy from the Nadis. If
the double is able to reactivate the center point (located near the
heart region in the physical body, somewhat to the right of the heart,
and often called the heart chakra), opening the channel for new energy
from the Soul Matrix to flow in, the new soul energy will reorganize the
errant patterns, if it can get through the mental body patterns.
“Expanding your mind” is no joke—it is a very important energy
process. The soul energy will then regulate the flow of the errant
energy into and through the body, in a way more harmonious to its
rhythms The energy will then pass into the Nadis where the body can draw
from it within its own rhythm pattern. If the double cannot reactivate
the center point, and “connect with soul” (open its energy systems to
that of the Soul Matrix) the double will experience emotional distress
and imbalance which will lead to disease of the body and early death. In
this case, there will be energy left within the Nadis that the body was
unable to process. The double in the other dimension (the one who
received the forced matrix transplant) is no longer available to receive
the energy, and so the energy becomes trapped within that dimension,
where it must wait until the time cycles allow it to reintegrate with
its Soul Matrix. The identity (individual human, for example) and its
Dolus (double) exist as one “identity package” within the Soul Matrix.
There are twelve such identity packages within one Soul Matrix, each
being extended into different time/space continuums within the
dimensional system.6 All of these “identity packages,” which we call
“aspects” or Tauren exist at once within the Soul Matrix and Time
Matrix, each experiencing its own line of linear development within its
respective time-space location. This group of twelve constitutes the
Soul Family, and the existence of one aspect (person) implies the
existence of the other eleven aspects. The soul family, which we call
the Dora moves in cyclic fashion within the Time Matrix. Within those
cycles each aspect has its own smaller cycle that constitutes its
passage through time, or its life span. There is a sequential
relationship to the aspect or Tauren cycles, which implies a correlation
between the births and deaths of its incarnates (Tauren/aspects). In the
case of “soul robbery” through forced matrix transplant, the early
demise of the double/Dolus affects the entire Soul Matrix cycle (we call
the cycles of the Soul Matrix the Aundanct Cycles and the smaller aspect
cycles the Tauren Cycles). All of the Tauren are accelerated in their
rhythms and all will reach depletion of cellular energy sooner than they
would have otherwise. All will thus leave residual nadial energy within
their respective dimensions which will become trapped there unless at
least one of the Tauren are able to activate the center point and
accelerate their physical body enough to allow the residual energies of
all of the other Tauren to be expanded into their own nadial field. If
one is able to perform this feat and complete its own nadial
composition, then the Soul Matrix can move out of the dimensional bands
involved. The Soul Matrix can evolve in this case. The Soul Matrix
cannot leave the dimensional octave it is in until all of its residual
energies are pulled back into the Soul Matrix. So you can see, if the
Zeta implement their plan of forced matrix transplant upon large numbers
of humans, a vast number of other individuals and soul
Families/Dora/Soul Matrices will be adversely affected. They will become
stuck within their positions in the Time Matrix and unable to evolve
until those trapped energies are released. Perhaps now you will be able
to comprehend the serious nature of our communications. Much is at stake
within this human/Zeta drama, most of which humans do not understand.
The events and practices we have mentioned in this section all have
direct bearing upon the future of your system, and the plan to begin the
aforementioned “mental takeover” is now beginning to emerge within your
three-dimensional Earth system. We have explained some of the methods by
which this takeover will be orchestrated, from its inception through
holographic inserts to its culmination in the Zeta Collective Mind link
up through forced matrix transplant. This is the plan that humans can
help to redirect, by making a strong, genuine connection to their own
Soul Matrix/Dora and learning to handle themselves within holographic
inserts and Zeta abductions. These things are already going on around
you, whether or not you are aware of them, whether or not you choose to
believe that it is true. Those who understand can do a great deal to
assist themselves, their Soul Families and their fellow humans if they
are willing to grow, expand and learn. You might wonder how such a
massive “mental takeover” could be pulled off “behind your backs” so to
speak. It is more so being done “over your heads” literally, as the
manipulations involved are being conducted, to a large degree from
dimensional frequency bands that are higher than the range of your
perceptions. This is a plan that will take time to implement, so the
sooner you are aware of these events the sooner you will be able to
redirect your future In the following sections we will cover methods by
which you can protect yourselves from being brought under the control of
the aforementioned “frequency fence.” We will offer suggestions as to
how holographic inserts can be maneuvered and also some clues to look
for that will allow you to watch the progression of the events of which
we speak.  In closing this section let us leave you with one final
example of how this plan will be implemented, an example that may
illustrate the power of the holographic insert to persuade human
perception. What do you suppose might happen if ten thousand devout
Christians suddenly saw “Christ” float down upon a cloud (or a
spaceship). The skies tremble and open and the savior, in the flesh,
levitates down and begins to touch the heads of his beloved. Then he
says “Come with me to the promised kingdom,” as a brilliant set of
“pearly gates” appears behind him. “Follow” he utters as he turns and
begins to walk through the gates. Do you think most of those devotees
would say “no”? And who would be the wiser, (except those creating the
holographic insert), if those masses passed beyond the gates in ecstasy
only to be marched through a dimensional portal. A portal their
biological forms are not prepared to encounter. Who would mourn those
people as they entered the portal and were incinerated upon contact,
their bodies destroyed and their consciousness fragmented into the
ethers while onlookers watched them move joyfully through the gates of
heaven? A rather ingenious way to evacuate a planet of “undesirables” to
clear the real estate for resettlement. Even those who did not go would
not believe that anything bad had happened. The masses simply “went with
Christ to the promised lands,” as had been foretold. This is what a
holographic insert can do! And some of the Zeta, the unenlightened ones
following the old agenda, are quite capable of this type of travesty.
Not only are they capable of this, this is precisely the type of
holographic drama they have planned once the “frequency fence” is in
place. If you find security in the concept of being “sheep,” then
please, make sure you know who your shepherd is!</p>
