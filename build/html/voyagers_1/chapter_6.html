          <p>Chapter 6: Special Projects</p>
<p>Crop Circles Our discussion on the phenomenon you refer to as “crop
circles” will be brief at this time, enough perhaps to arouse your
curiosity about the nature of events, such as this, that you do not as
yet understand. The items we are referring to in this discussion are the
land marking formations that have appeared through seemingly mysterious
means within many areas of your global community. Our discussion
excludes those “crop circle” formations that have been fraudulently
constructed by select humans who desire covert notoriety or whom
purposely desire to lead you away from the validity of actual “crop
circling.” Also excluded in our discussion will be the circular and
other formations in fields and in other locations, that are the result
of mechanical contact, such as that of an air craft or space craft from
human or ET origins. To those of you who may balk at the concept of ET
visitations, we say to you: “Prepare yourselves—for throughout the
next several decades much learning shall come your way!” ETs are real,
and their visitations should by now be obvious to you. Pay attention and
you will begin to see the mounting evidence suggestive of such presence
all about you. Genuine crop circles (and the many other-than-circular
symbol patterns) that are emerging spontaneously “over night” in your
fields, deserts and country sides are far more than you might at first
glance suspect. Those who venture to believe in the authenticity of
these formations speculate that they are perhaps “landing coordinates”
for ET space craft or messages “left behind” from stellar Visitors who
have passed through your system. We will tell you this: These symbol
formations are not at all “landing pads” nor are they simply dry ET
language symbols “left behind” by some long-gone Visitor. They are far
more indeed. First, let it be known that the appearance of such a symbol
code is the direct indication that ET and/or interdimensional Visitor
presence is presently and actively taking place within the regions of
its manifestation. Where you have crop circles, you most absolutely have
active “alien” operations being carried out within the geography and the
populace in and surrounding those areas. The crop circles will begin to
fade only when the presence responsible for creating them has left the
location, so as long as a crop formation remains visible you have active
and ongoing alien presence. Just as there are ETs possessing benign
intentions towards humans, and others with ill-purposed agendas, so too
are there crop circles with benign, helpful or harmful purposes. Crop
formations are not created through the use of mechanical devices, nor
are most of them formed through “laser-like” technologies. The majority
of these formations are created through direct manipulation of subatomic
energy imprints, whereas the designs emerge as part of the organic
air/land pattern of the particular geography. They are “cast,” so to
speak, within the electromagnetic imprint of the organic elements as a
result of intended multi-dimensional manipulations carried out by
Visitors.</p>
<p>Neurological Stimulation Some “crop formations” serve the purpose of
stimulating or accelerating the subtle neurological structures of the
local inhabitants, while others serve to repress, “scramble” or
desensitize those subtle biological processes. Crop formations are one
application of the multidimensional language of Keylonta. It is the
language spoken by the core of your biologies, and by the very nature of
your elemental world itself. Crop formations have multiple purposes.
Their primary purpose is to house frequency, or to “ground” into the
location certain frequency bands intended to affect the populace in very
specific ways. They are composed of frequency patterns, and they
directly affect the frequency patterns of all biological life forms
within their intended range of influence. This range can span a radius
well over several thousand miles from its point of origin. The
formations are often placed in sequential fashion, sometimes thousands
of miles apart, but each serving as part of a greater frequency pattern
that is nearly impossible to detect from ground level human perception.
Crop formations are your first visible, physical evidence of ET presence
presently available to you on a mass level. They are subliminal
programming devices being used to manipulate, direct or guide you
through the intimate unknown structures of your subconscious minds and
biochemical and electrical systems. They are one type of what we know as
mass frequency control devices. You are dealing here with technologies
light years beyond the scope of your present human abilities. Many of
the crop formations have been placed so as to assist you by
counteracting the effects of other placements that were intended to do
you harm. Presently there are more helpful crop formations in place than
are their harmful counterparts. More will appear as you progress into
the next century. It is important for you to understand that whether the
formations are harmful or helpful they are directly influencing you in
complex ways on subliminal levels. You must learn to use them, or they
will instead serve as the vessels through which you are used. Attempting
to destroy the visible evidence of such a formation will in no way
“disarm” its attributes. Once it is in place the frequency it harnessed
has been indelibly coded into the land, air and biological forms of the
region. It is for this reason that the helpful ETs, who became aware of
how the formations were being used to harm you, found it necessary to
counter the offending codes rather than to simply disengage them from
operational focus. There is much you need to learn about such advanced
technologies and those such as ourselves are quite willing to share our
knowledge with you, so that you may learn the skills required to protect
yourselves from those who wish to do and who are presently doing harm to
large percentages of your populations. We will offer more extensive data
on the mechanics of crop formations at a future time, for those of you
interested in learning more about the hidden realities that affect you.
We hope this transmission has offered to you some practical insight into
the mysterious phenomenon you call “crop circles.”</p>
<p>Adjacent Earth and Zeta In these transmissions we have discussed the
subjects of UFOs and ET and interdimensional Visitors as well as a wide
range of related topics that we hope have broadened your understanding
or at least aroused your curiosity. All of the subjects addressed are
relevant to your continued development and successful evolution, whether
you realize this or not. The information on the Zeta Reticuli is
intended specifically for those who have encountered this presence, and
there are many more of you than you might suppose. Your assistance and
courage are needed to help direct the remaining unenlightened Zeta
toward their higher vision, as held by the Aethien and other Guardian
groups. Through the fulfillment of this vision, the Zeta will be able to
evolve successfully within another dimension more suitable to their
needs, and they will no longer believe they must compete with humans for
the territory of your three-dimensional Earth. Helping them to heal and
grow will ensure your protection well into the future, as they will have
no need to harm you once they realize as a collective that there is
another home for them within the universe. Certain among you (the
readers) are being called to assist in a “special project” of sorts,
which involves the Zeta, Aethien, Zionites and the Ranthia. Those of you
who carry the silicate matrix/crystal gene within your genetic code, and
who have begun to develop abilities in multi-dimensional perception and
manipulation. You will know who you are and if this message is
appropriate for you. The rest of you not involved in these endeavors can
get a glimpse into some of the activities that are taking place beyond
your notice. We have discussed the realities of other dimensional worlds
as they exist parallel and adjacent to you own, and how the Zeta are
able to travel through some of these other systems. We have reviewed the
new Zeta agenda of relocation to an adjacent dimension where they will
be welcomed. Many of the guardian groups are working to assist the Zeta
in making this adjustment, and humans (those of you who are ready) are
being asked to serve as the true Earth guardians that you are by working
cooperatively with the other guardian groups to ensure the success of
the new Zeta agenda. You are being asked to telepathically broadcast, to
the Zeta communities at large, the knowledge of this new option, and use
your abilities in “mental-energy linking” to help them align with one of
the inter-dimensional grids assigned to them. (You’ll achieve this by
using visualization and projection of consciousness techniques during
times of directed meditation, and after centering in the energies of
your soul matrix. Those to whom we speak in this message know what we
are talking about, these techniques will seem foreign only to those who
have not awakened their higher senses.) Some of you are already doing
this and we thank you for your concern and support. There are other
elements to this Zeta relocation that we need to address briefly, for
those who are awakening to their soul matrix contracts of participation
in this plan. The adjacent Earth that the Zeta are being directed to
will be a good learning environment for the Zeta. It is a fourth
dimension Earth system. This system also has its human, ET and
interdimensional inhabitants. It is a system of much less density than
your own and so the natural laws operate differently than those to which
you are accustomed. Many of you, the Starseeds (those of you carrying
the silicate matrix) are able to access the portals to this system
during your sleep state (the “sacred dream time”) or during altered
states of consciousness. Some of you are able to hold focus in this
fourth-dimensional world and your own world simultaneously, and are
somewhat familiar with the “lay of the land” in this locality. (You may
be involved with this project during the dream time but have no
conscious recall. This reminder will help you to consciously recall some
of what you have been up to while you were “sleeping.”) It is to you
with dual focusing abilities to whom we now speak (again, you will know
who you are.) First, we would like you to understand (if you do not
already) that the events in this fourth-dimensional world directly
affect manifestations within your three-dimensional system. What occurs
there will “plant the seeds” for what eventually manifests within your
system. In the world to which the Zeta are being directed there exist
structures and forms similar to your own. Just as there are
“unenlightened” forces, often in “high places” within your governmental
structures, these forms also exist with this fourth-dimensional reality.
The Zeta need your help to integrate themselves into this system, but of
even more importance, those working toward enlightenment in that
dimension need your help to redirect some of the misguided projects
taking place within their world. One of these projects in particular
must be shifted, for if it is not its pattern will manifest in your
world, in your future. It is the project of the old Zeta agenda and the
secret Interior Government that we previously discussed in relation to
your three-dimensional system. In this fourth-dimensional system this
project has progressed farther than it presently has within your system.
In earlier chapters we reviewed some of the aspects observable within a
Zeta-ruled society. What is taking place within this fourth-dimensional
Earth represents the evolution of that society. In this locality the
“Invisible Big Brother” has done a number of things, which have left the
inhabitants of that time-space coordinate without many of the freedoms
you presently enjoy. Here, the Interior Government has chosen to barter
the organic resources of their planet to intrusive ET factions within
their galaxy. Energy is being siphoned from their planet and their
people, and is being directed into other planetary systems. The
consequences for them are dire if the project moves forth into their
future. Not only will they destroy the planetary balances of their own
system, but they will set in motion a chain reaction that will literally
cut off this world, and its surrounding galaxies and inter-dimensional
counterparts, from the time matrix grid. They will “rip a hole in the
fabric of time,” so to speak. In the sectors of future time where this
has occurred, your three- dimensional system was also cut off from its
higher dimensional grid. In that line of probable future development of
Earth, the Earth meets an untimely end in the year 2976 AD. The 2976 AD
cataclysm is further addressed in Voyagers Volume II: The Secrets of
Amenti. All of us who are concerned with human and universal evolution
to enlightenment are helping to avert this probability. We are trying to
disconnect your Earth coordinate from the adjacent system that is in
peril. In order to do this, and to stop this pattern from manifesting
within your reality, the pattern must be altered from above, within and
below its frequency placement. Your world exists below, and your help is
needed. In this fourth-dimensional system the Interior Government works
“behind the scenes” while a “puppet government” maintains the illusion
of freedom for the people. The “One-World Order” is in place within this
world and so this governmental structure applies globally. Here the
Interior Government is particularly interested in creating a human-like
hybrid mutation, but not in combination with the Zeta race. In this
system the Zeta plan “backfired,” and they were “denied the fruits of
their labors,” as the technology they had provided was used in
agreements with outside ET groups, to the exclusion of the Zeta. The
Interior Government collaborated with the reptilian Dracos race to
overthrow the Zeta power holdings. The Zeta were reduced to a
“working-class” status, and live in fear of the now more powerful
Interior Government and its new Dracos allies. The Zeta had provided the
technology and knowledge of genetics that the Interior Government needed
to create the hybrid prototype species it desired. The leaders planned
to create these bodies and then re-inhabit them (the hybrid prototype
had many physical advantages compared to the human body), or “possess”
them if you will, along with chosen members of their Dracos allies. This
“super race” was created with the primary purpose of having a biology
that was strong and resilient enough to move through the time and
inter-dimensional portal systems without being destroyed. The covert
government and its allies are aware of the damage they have been doing
to their planet and believe that one day their resources will be
expended or contaminated to the degree that their survival will not be
possible. Nuclear energy is also used in this fourth- dimensional
system, and they have only partially discovered how to neutralize the
waste materials. They have violated and disrupted the natural balances
of their oceans with waste treatment and realize they cannot continue
this process. Using technology of the Zeta they have instead devised a
way of transporting the radioactive materials, in small amounts, into
other dimensional systems, through the portals they have accessed. Your
system is one of those on their target list for such dumping. This
process has not yet begun, in terms of your time orientation, but will
be instrumented within the next 40 to 50 years of your time, if your
Earth is not shifted out of alignment with this fourth- dimensional time
continuum (this time shift is addressed extensively in Voyagers, Volume
II: The Secrets of Amenti). Their method seems ingenious from the
outside. Understanding some of the relationships between objects, matter
and time that exist between parallel dimensions, their scientists have
created a way to transmit radioactive materials from their generators,
into other generators that exist within a parallel or adjacent
time-space coordinate in other dimensions. If this should occur, your
scientists would find themselves baffled, as the amount of radioactive
waste created in your plants would appear to double, with no increase in
power output or source materials. The waste materials would appear to
you as being intensified in power, or radioactivity. And your
technologies are light years away from being able to decipher how this
intensification is occurring or from where the increased radioactivity
is emerging. Needless to say, such an event would prove treacherous to
your system, as not only are you not prepared to dispose of such
intensified waste, but your reactors themselves are not designed to
process those amounts of radioactivity. Over time, this stress would
cause your reactors to explode. Period. The fourth-dimension scientists
are aware of this possibility but they are not concerned with these
outcomes for you. Their only concern is in being able to shut the
portals prior to your systems reactor overloads, so when they “blow”
their own reactors will not be destabilized in the process. In their
plan your reactors would not overload immediately, as the excess
radioactive materials would be filtered into a state of dimensional
suspension or “suspended animation” then slowly released into your (and
other) systems. Over time the process would create buildups and more
rapid deterioration of your processors. The interior fourth-dimension
government views this as a good temporary solution to their problems.
They do not realize the dire effects and chain reactions it would create
for all systems involved. This project must be redirected from your
three-dimensional system. We will elaborate upon this as our discussion
continues. Part of what is now taking place within that society is the
involuntary abduction of women who possess desired genetic strains, and
the chemical sterilization of all men and women the government considers
to be of a “lesser” genetic heritage. Children are born by permit only,
and many people have been put to death for unlawful procreation. The
“puppet government” runs a campaign of disinformation and propaganda
whereby the populace is led to believe that these policies are in the
best interest of the global community. As if these conditions were not
bad enough, the covert forces have begun the process of mass mutation,
while the populace over which it has control has no knowledge of what is
being done to them. Contrived chemical elements are added to the water
and food supply, the air is “drugged” with ionic “enhancers”7 and
inaudible sound and frequencies are being employed to manipulate and
control the biological and mental processes of the people. The
population has no idea these things are taking place —no idea that
slowly their bodies are being destroyed and cut off completely from
their Soul Matrices.8 Most of the population within this
fourth-dimensional world is human. The human species within that reality
is being destroyed and mutated into extinction as a biological entity.
This system is tightly controlled. Individuals in these cultures cannot
receive telepathic or Keylonta communications such as you can. Their
intuitive facility has been chemically blocked, without their knowledge.
Their emotions have been sedated and drained of energy, and their minds
have been controlled through the use of electromagnetic interruption.
They are slaves without the luxury of knowing it. They think they are
free people and they cannot see their own digression. You may feel
unconcerned about this information, after all this world exists in
another dimension and “you have your own problems.” Well, let us tell
you this: your three-dimensional system is one of the coordinates their
rulers have in mind for experimentation. They have not yet decided
whether your system will be used as a new home when their planet’s
resources are depleted, or whether you will be used as a dumping ground
for their radioactive waste materials. But either way, because you are
so closely related in your time portal systems, your area of the
dimensional map is a primary target. One part of their plan involves the
infiltration of such target systems. (Events in your present time
directly affect conditions in t hat future time continuum, and it is for
this reason that the unenlightened Zeta currently desire to place your
populations under mind control. The connections between your Earth and
this D-4 system is further discussed in Voyagers Volume II: Secrets of
Amenti.)Your system already possesses the Interior Government and will
soon be linking into the world bank and what has been called the “world
management team.” These entities are already a reality within your
system. The public will remain unaware as these structures grow in
power. Presently they do not possess the power or knowledge held by the
fourth-dimensional adjacent system. Most of these manifestations within
your system stem from this fourth- dimensional system. They are
attempting to infiltrate your system, and if successful, turn it into
another version of what they have created within their home territory.
You, as relatively free humans must not allow this to happen. In this
adjacent system everything seems beautiful and harmonious to the “naked
eye.” People seem to be blissful (not unlike what a massive dose of a
mood-enhancing drug added to your water supply might do for you). The
illusion of beauty is a perpetually maintained holographic insert, that
the humans there believe is reality. As the emotional and intuitive
aspects of these people are being controlled they are unable to feel the
true reality beneath the hologram. If an individual somehow begins to
sense that something is amiss, begins to question, becomes “fatigued”
with such “concerns,” the government is fast to “assist” him. If
“healing drugs” are not successful in reprogramming his thoughts (and
realigning him with the propaganda program), the individual is sent away
for “rehabilitation.” Family and friends are allowed to visit. However,
the person they visit is also a hologram, as the human who entered
“treatment” has been destroyed. You must become aware that your system
is dangerously close to directly interfacing with this
fourth-dimensional reality field. That reality exists as one of your
potential futures. One you all could do very well without! There are
things that you, as enlightened and awakening humans, can do to assist
those in your world who are aligned with this potential future. And
there are many who fit into this category. Let us look for a moment at
your American culture—the greatest example of a free citizenry and
enterprise system on your planet at this time. What do you think is the
mind set of the “norm,” the “average” human functioning within that
system? We are referring here to the cultural or “tribal” mind, the
“consensual reality.” In the “official” view of things (those ideas
perpetuated through your media, your social, business and religious
institutions and your schools), you are taught to believe that some
things are true, others are not; some behaviors are acceptable, others
not; and some ideas valid, others not. You are taught to view your
reality and define yourselves in a certain way in order to be
acceptable, functional and “normal” within your cultural boundaries. We
shall call these views and definitions the “base program” upon which
your citizens function. Within the complex network of theologies and
ideologies of your belief systems there exist central ideas or core
beliefs, upon which all the other beliefs are “stacked” or out of which
the other surface beliefs emerge. The majority of people operate on this
base program of culturally mandated beliefs automatically. The program,
its core elements and even the knowledge that the program exists operate
on what you would call “subconscious” levels. This implies that these
inner programs are directing you, rather than you directing or
consciously choosing them. This means that, as individuals, you are not
“owning your personal power.” You are not empowered, but rather dis-
empowered, as these subconscious programs direct the workings of your
mental, emotional and physical system. In this Age of Enlightenment part
of your healing, part of your evolutionary challenge, is to reclaim that
power, access those hidden programs and attain sovereignty over those
hidden portions of your identity. In this way you will become
enlightened, powerful and free to choose consciously the ideas and
beliefs that direct the patterns of your inner forces. Now we shall ask:
does your mainstream consensual reality teach you of these things? Do
you learn from childhood that you are a blessed multidimensional being
here to manifest self sovereignty? Are you taught that you are meant to
be powerful, fulfilled and free? Does your training prepare you to work
cooperatively in co-creation with others, or does it teach you to
separate yourself from others and compete for limited rewards? Do the
ideas of those around you convince you that the world is a safe and
joyful place, or do they suggest that the world is cold and dangerous?
Are you trained to reach out to your fellow humans in trust, or to be
suspicious, protect yourself and retreat in fear? Are you taught to love
yourselves, your bodies and others, or to judge and condemn? Are you
taught of the ways of loving, cooperative, co-creative brotherhood in
mainstream thought? The answer to these questions is an obvious “no.”
Just examine your daily newspapers and television broadcasts, or attend
a local business school. What attitudes and subtle suggestions do they
imply? Your mainstream program tells you that everywhere you are
helpless and victimized by forces beyond your control, that the world is
a harsh and cruel place of limited resources for which you must compete,
that your bodies are vulnerable and unable to protect themselves against
disease, that humanity is chaotic or “sinful” and human nature cannot be
trusted. You are trained to believe through constant repetition and
reinforcement that there is not “enough” and you must always need more,
and that you are not enough. Not pretty enough or smart enough, strong
enough, fast enough, powerful enough, wealthy enough or good enough. You
are taught, just as your parents had been, to believe that you are only
what exists between the top of your head and the tip of your toes. You
are trained to doubt the self, fear the self, punish the self and to
place your trust in authorities or “experts” that exist outside of you.
You are taught to long for but be afraid of power, and to fear your
ability to handle it wisely. Emotion is power, and so it is expected
that within this program you are taught to invalidate and repress
emotional cognition. The intuitions and higher senses give you direct
access to greater power and knowledge. And you are taught to negate,
fear, devalue, disown and discredit intuitive perception and knowledge.
Does it sound like this “official” mainstream program is designed to
help you to become empowered or free? You are programmed to believe that
what is on the outside is more important than what is on the inside and
to continually distract yourselves with the more important external
aspects of reality. Does your mainstream program encourage you to look
within for answers, to discover your own innate power to create change
or to spend time exploring the vast uncharted frontier that exists
“between your ears”? The “average American” is far too busy,
overburdened or distracted to take the time to explore the self,
everything else seems “more important.” And many are far too
“intellectually smug” to admit that the self is a great unknown, and too
frightened to approach the inner psyche with an open mind. In your
present consensual reality program you are trained from infancy to
disown the self, to subjugate yourselves to outside authority and to
project your personal power outward onto other people or circumstances.
From birth you are trained to accept the perceptions of others as being
more valid than your own, and to “appease” others at all costs. You are
directed into schools that are designed to squelch creativity and
personal identity to create “good little students” who obey their
teachers and follow the rules. Then you enter into an economic structure
that further programs you to obey the authorities, work for others and
allow others to benefit in unfair proportions from the investments of
your energies and labor. You are taught that in order to survive you
must either please others at all cost (because they hold your power) or
to fight your way through the system to make it (and forcibly reclaim
your power). Sacrifice the self, serve others, work hard, make more, buy
more, need more…compete, push, produce. Look at the messages your
mainstream reality and its hidden belief program are sending your
citizens over and over: look at how you are programmed to create disease
in your bodies and minds, because no one ever told you that you had the
power to change the program and make better, healthier idea choices. No
one ever told you that “thoughts are things” that create reality. The
base program that people of your time have been subconsciously following
has trained you to close your minds, and to fear, judge and condemn many
of the ideas and technologies (such as those of intuitive development)
that would heal you and set you free. We are simply asking you, for the
sake of your evolution, to look at the program. And ask yourselves: Does
it nurture human potential or does it limit its possibilities? Is it a
humane program of ideas that begets brotherhood and harmony, or does it
create separation, segregation and power struggle? Does it allow you to
love and honor yourselves and others? Does it teach you respect for all
life? It does not.  Beloved humans, who do you think is responsible for
changing the program? Religions? God? The government? The doctors and
scientists? The bureaucracies? These are the very organizations and
institutions that stand to benefit most from keeping these
self-defeating programs intact. When people can lead themselves they do
not need leaders, and when people can heal themselves they do not need
healers. When people realize that “God” exists within them and that they
exist within that force, they will not need others to save them.
Discovering, comprehending, changing and healing the base belief program
is the responsibility of each individual whose life is immersed within
and controlled by that program. And each individual that can
successfully make conscious changes and create a more rewarding idea
program makes it easier for the next person to succeed. We have spoken
to you of the fourth-dimensional adjacent Earth and of the plight of the
people living within that system (a reality your mainstream belief
program would tell you does not exist). We have done a bit of “program
bashing” in regard to your consensual reality. What do these issues have
in common? Where do you think much of your three-dimensional
“brainwashing” base belief program is coming from? It is coming from
this fourth-dimensional system. Should it not be just a bit worrisome to
you that the majority of people within your “first world countries” are
subconsciously operating on this base idea program? The “lightworkers”
(those embracing the path of enlightenment who are working toward the
successful evolution of the species) of this information age are
bringing healing alternatives to your planet. They offer to you an
expanded, less limited, health giving program of ideas. They will become
self aware, empowered creators who are able to break free from the
brainwashing of the old base program. And they will light the way for
others to follow. We call them “lightworkers” because they bring the
light of understanding to your species. They will have the courage to
break through the old program, creating freedom through mastery and
brotherhood through love. Through the new program of ideas they offer,
you will be led, if you so choose, out of the subconscious controls of
the fourth-dimensional system, and in your freedom you will leave a new
“pathway of thought” for those trapped within that system to follow. In
helping yourselves, in growing, you will assist those within the
fourth-dimensional system to grow. Even though you reside dimensions
apart you are connected in ways that you cannot yet understand. And just
as their idea programs affect you and your world, so too can your chosen
programs affect that reality. And so when we ask you to assist them we
are asking you to take control of the program as it operates within your
own private psyche, free yourselves and learn to create brotherhood and
joy while you still have the freedom to make that conscious choice. In
doing so you will affect much more than you realize. (In future
transmissions we will introduce you to the Keylonta Code technologies so
you may begin using these tools as you work to heal your base idea
programs). What will happen to those who choose to remain trapped within
the illusion of comfort and security offered by the old program? What
future might they be headed for? Perhaps a dimensional interface with
that fourth-dimensional world we described. Could it be possible that
the people upon the Earth are beginning to sort themselves into
categories defined by the focus of their subconscious core belief
programs? Each group preparing to meet a version of Earth’s future that
is consistent with that focus? If you had a greater understanding of
universal physics and the operational cycles and dynamics of the time
and dimensional portal systems, those questions would be statements, for
you would understand the greater evolution of which your species and
Earth are a part. Consider this question for a moment: if this was a
true depiction of the circumstances upon your planet, which probable
version of Earth would you be aligned with? What base idea program do
you follow? Have you ever stopped to consider what ideas and beliefs
motivate your actions and emotions from a subconscious level? This
perhaps is a good time to begin exploring. Those of you who have already
developed interdimensional skills and are fluent in the languages of the
higher senses are needed to assist those among you who are trapped
within the old consensual reality program to redirect the energies of
their beliefs. The greatest way to make a difference in the
third-dimensional arena is to use your inter- dimensional mind skills
and project your consciousness into the fourth- dimensional field.
(Simply hold the intention in mind—where the thought goes energy
flows.) From there you can manifest whatever you hold in mind into
three-dimensional reality.  Hold the vision of freedom and brotherhood
and you will create change. The fourth-dimensional world we speak of
exists now, in dimensional coordinates different than your Earth, but it
also exists as a future reality for some of those now residing upon your
Earth. There is a select group of lightworkers in your system now that
have come to work on this or similar projects. You will know who you are
as you will feel intuitively drawn to this information. If you would
like more information or desire to communicate with us, you may request
an encounter with the Ranthia during meditation or prior to sleep. We
are willing to assist those who desire our involvement. You have been
drawn into your reality for a reason. Only you can discover what that
reason is and what significance this information holds for you. For
those of you who do not feel connected to these “special projects,” we
have allowed you a glimpse into some of the truly amazing things that
are going on around you, so that in your quest for personal purpose you
may “think bigger” and “reach higher,” realizing that you are not
limited by the old concepts of identity that you once accepted. You are
intended to grow beyond them. Early in our transmission we mentioned
that there are two advanced ET groups presently working within your
Earth system who have the knowledge and power of holographic and portal
mechanics. The Zeta and the Ranthia both exist as smaller sub-groups
within the larger identity of these collectives. The Ranthia could be
viewed as the guardians and overseers of the time portal projects, and
we are closely affiliated with those who have been called “the keepers
of time” (Maya) in your system. We would represent the greater identity
gestalt (having a variety of race manifestations within various reality
fields) out of which the Maya collective had emerged into your system.
We, the Ranthia, and other time portal guardian groups are beginning to
interface with your system once again, as we always do when the cycles
of time put your system within proximity to our own. Some humans are
also involved in the time portal projects through subconscious (from
your perspective) Soul Matrix agreements. We will give you a clue as to
which humans are involved with these endeavors. Those of you who are
drawn to, have interest in, or have had direct encounters with the UFO,
ET or “Visitor” phenomena are those affiliated with the time portal
projects. Whether your experiences were “positive or negative” from your
perspective, they were intended to teach you many things about
yourselves and the illusive worlds of time in which you reside. The
first step toward understanding is facing your fear and moving beyond it
into the wisdom that shines like a beacon from the other side. In our
closing section we have a few comments for your scientists as they
become faced with more and more evidence of multi- dimensional
realities. And we will offer a parting message to those of you who have
had the open-minded fortitude and courage to follow our winding pathway
of information to its natural end. But this ending is in truth only a
beginning, for there are many more roads to travel upon the journey to
enlightenment. For those of you desiring to continue along your journey,
we will provide more information at other times, in other transmissions.
You could view the closing of this communication as simply a resting
spot upon the road. We have the utmost faith in your abilities to pull
yourselves through the challenges we have mentioned, and we have no
doubt whatsoever that you will evolve through time to emerge as the
grand and wonderful co-creative guardian species that intrinsically you
are. During our time of interface with your system we will offer
whatever assistance we can to help you upon your path toward
understanding. Until we meet again, happy trails to you as you spiral
through the matrix of time.</p>
<p>Helping Abductees We have one parting commentary to your scientists and
others who are studying the phenomena of “UFO/alien abduction.” Many of
you are going to great lengths to “prove” that such abductions are not
“real” events but rather aberrations of mind on the part of the
abductee. You tend to view the experience as some type of hallucination
or symbolic cover memory of terrestrial events. Many of you in the
“mainstream helping professions” attempt to invalidate the experiences,
choosing rather to medicate your “patients” or to apply therapies geared
toward rationalizing away the validity of the experience. In viewing the
abduction phenomena in this way you are not only denying yourselves the
possibility of true understanding, but you are doing a terrible
disservice to those individuals who come to you for assistance in
finding perspective on real events that have traumatized them because
they have no basis upon which to understand their experiences. You are
not serving them by invalidating the integrity of their perceptions, but
instead you are intensifying their trauma by undermining the abductees
sense of self-confidence and innate ability to heal. In devaluing the
reality of their perceptions you are helping them to lose rather than
gain control over the experiences which frighten and disturb them. In
your privilege of serving your fellow humans you have the responsibility
of putting your personal prejudice aside enough to grow, so that you may
continue to serve the ever changing needs of those who come to you for
service. Humanity is evolving before your eyes, and with that evolution
comes changes in perception and a rapidly expanding field of experience.
Scientific thought must also evolve if it is to comprehend the nature of
the human experience. Scientists, doctors and teachers, you also must
grow and evolve your own ideas, if you are to be effective within your
professions. You must learn to learn from your subjects, patients and
students as well as serving to guide them. You alone, through the idea
framework of your traditions, do not have all of the answers. Through
their experiences and challenges you will learn more about yourselves
and the nature of the universe in which you live. Though some abduction
cases might be contrived mental mal- alignments and others intended
hoax, there are many quite legitimate occurrences of actual ET
abductions. If you were to use hypnosis as a primary diagnostic tool you
would find a vast number of such abduction memories surfacing, even from
those who have no conscious recall of UFO or Visitor encounter. Great
numbers of your population have been involved with this phenomenon but
have no conscious indication of their involvement. An alarming amount of
the mental and emotional problems emerging within your populace can be
directly attributed to ET encounters of which there is no conscious
memory, but only a residual emotional imprint of the events as stored
within cellular memory. These stored emotional imprints of unresolved
abduction issues exist beneath the surface of consciousness, creating
mental reactions and behaviors consistent with other forms of repressed
trauma. Until you realize that “Visitor” abduction is a primary subject
to which you should look for cause of psychological and emotional
disturbance, you will be unable to resolve the casual elements of the
maladies; instead you will use drug therapies or analysis to treat the
symptoms, but the individual will not be truly healed until the reality
of the trauma is identified and brought into the conscious awareness. 
How can you assist your patients to integrate and thus heal from their
experiences when you refuse to believe the framework from which their
trauma arose exists? As long as you medicate away the emotional and
psychological symptoms of your patients you will be unable to discover
the true nature of their condition. The body itself directly responds to
the energy data held within the emotional and subconscious facilities.
The memory imprints and subconscious information are stored within the
cells in the form of electrical impulse patterns, and these patterns set
the manifestation cycles of chemical and hormonal relationships within
the body. The chemical and hormonal imbalances, and the brain function
deviations9 you see within your mentally disturbed individuals are the
symptoms of electrical impulse abnormalities stored within the cells,
and these abnormalities arise when the individual is unable to
assimilate (for whatever reason) sense data into coherent patterns of
electrical impulse that the body is oriented to synthesize. What you
repress through drugs, physical manipulations, or psychological
diversion will continue to remain within the subconscious mind, and will
continue to create within the body and mind the same patterns of
imbalance. Until the causal aspects of stored experience are found and
brought to the conscious awareness in the form of remembered events and
emotive impressions.Though these impressions may seem erratic, there
does exist an associative relationship between them, and if attempts are
made to bring these erratic impressions into logical, sequential order
within the conscious mind the repressed electrical impulse patterns
causing the imbalances will be “plugged in” to the conscious awareness
where they can be processed as experiential events and thus released and
healed. As the mal-aligned electrical impulse patterns are assimilated
and released through the conscious mind, so too will be the biological,
psychological and emotional distortions that arose through those
mal-aligned impulses. Your traditions have much to learn in regard to
the mechanics of the psyche and its intimate relationship to the
biological and bio- energetic aspects of your being. Until your
scientific traditions begin viewing all aspects of the human dynamic in
terms of energy relationships, they will have difficulty comprehending
the true mechanics that exist behind the dynamics they observe. When
science and religion begin to mend their ideological beliefs, and both
come into the scientific awareness of the Soul Matrix, or extended
energetic identity gestalt that is the foundation upon which all matter
and identity is built, spirituality, psychology and biology will evolve
into the new understandings out of which intelligent holistic therapies
can be created. But until that time human experiential evolution rushes
forward in leaps and bounds, and those within the helping professions
must catch up with this growth if they are not to become obsolete. For
the present time it would do you well to realize that “Visitor”
abduction is occurring on a mass level and it affects large numbers of
the population, whether or not you believe that this phenomenon exists
as a “physically real” reality. Rather than wasting time trying to prove
it is not real, might we suggest that you direct that time and energy
into finding methods with which to deal with this reality effectively?
Your practice of hypnotic therapy is a starting point. This method
appears to you as unreliable, with inconsistent results only because
you, as yet, do not understand the inner language of energy that the
psyche speaks. You do not know what to look for, or how to assemble
memory and sensory patterns that emerge from within the subconscious
mind. You do not yet realize that there are ordered, sequential
electrical impulse patterns existing within cellular structure, and you
do not comprehend that the physical tissue of the body matter is the
storehouse and assimilation facility of the human organism. There is as
much memory stored within your little toe as there is stored within your
brain matter. The mind is not only located “in your head” and within the
cellular structure of the brain, it is manifest throughout the entire
body structure, from a hair follicle to a strand of DNA. Every molecule
and particle is imbued with consciousness. Consciousness is not an
attribute of mind. Mind is an attribute of consciousness. And
consciousness is an attribute of energy. Your “subconscious” mind is
that portion of your experiential identity you have yet to assimilate
into your conscious awareness. Your subconscious mind exists within the
cells of your body and within the less dense forms of your bio-energetic
field. The subconscious has an intrinsic order but your conscious
awareness and biological form have not yet evolved enough to assimilate
that order fully. So to you, as conscious biological forms, the
attributes of the subconscious appear chaotic and disorganized from the
conscious mind perspective. As you evolve you will begin to understand
the logic of the subconscious awareness, and you will grow to hold the
operational dynamics of that facility within your conscious awareness.
And as you grow to understand these things you will grow to comprehend
the reality and meaning of the Visitor abduction experience. If you
would begin to acknowledge the validity of these experiences, and to
employ technologies of hypnosis and biofeedback to retrieve the memory
impressions that are being repressed within the body pattern, you would
begin to get a clearer picture of what takes place within the abduction
encounters. And you will begin to understand how the mind and body work
together to create the perceptual experience of three-dimensional
reality. You will then comprehend the greater significance of Visitor
abduction as you will understand the greater reality of the human
dynamic. Using hypnosis and biofeedback techniques you will be able to
access from the subconscious the memory and emotional imprints of an
abduction. You can use these techniques to design new therapies for more
traditional disturbances as well. The body will provide answers to your
questions, if you allow it to, and if you are able to set up a method by
which the body can translate its information into terms (language, sense
perception or symbols) your conscious mind can understand. Using
techniques of hypnotic disassociation induced through hypnotic
suggestion, you can “ask the body” to communicate to you the nature of
its malady. You can “ask the body” of the subject in a natural state of
disassociation (drugs and mechanical manipulation of the brain/ body
systems disrupt the organic patterns of electrical impulse) to
communicate to you whether or not the subject has been involved with
Visitor abduction events, and whether these events are responsible for
the condition of disease the subject has manifested. Using such “body
talk” techniques you can assist the body to heal the condition by
discussing the specific course of action you might take to remedy the
condition. You are not simply dealing with “a body” as a “mindless
structure of biological functions,” you are dealing with an intelligent
awareness, that represents the portions of your greater mind that your
logical/intellectual mind has not yet assimilated. The body knows and
remembers far more than “you” do, and it knows what is needed for its
own healing. Your challenge is to train the logical awareness to
communicate directly with the body consciousness, and to set up a method
through which that communication can take place. Even in cases where
there is structural damage to the brain, “body talk” techniques may
still provide helpful data on the condition and treatment of the
individual. Mental illness can be “side-stepped” by the doctor, whereby
a direct body communication can be set up during the natural dream
state, but it is necessary for the subject to be drug free for at least
36 to 72 hours. Treatments for many psychological, emotional, behavioral
or physical conditions can be devised using “body talk” techniques and
such techniques are far more conducive of healing than are treatments
designed to repress the symptoms. If your scientists would venture to
explore the abduction phenomenon further, and begin taking random
samples of the population into controlled experiments of hypnotic
regression, biofeedback and “body talk” you would be amazed at the
regularity with which abduction memories will surface. Most individuals
who have been abducted have no conscious memory whatsoever of the
experience. And those who do represent a small portion of the abductee
population. You will often find seven out of ten randomly selected
subjects will have subconscious evidence of Visitor abduction.10 In
conducting such experimentation you could easily supply yourselves with
overwhelming evidence of the ongoing extraterrestrial involvement upon
your planet. You could prove the realities of which we speak to you, and
perhaps then you could design methods that would assist rather than
further traumatize those having such experiences. For once you prove to
yourselves the reality of the abduction experience, you will be faced
with the challenge of “diagnosing” what type of abduction has occurred.
The type of abduction will tell you many things about the genetic
reality of the subjects, and will also indicate the appropriate methods
of treatment for the subjects—on an individual basis. Forced
abductions (those that do not involve the subconscious/Soul Matrix
consent of the individual) require different handling than do those of a
consented nature. In forced abductions, the biological and psychological
integrity of the individual has been violated. The entire system,
conscious and subconscious, has been traumatized. This type of intrusion
often involves the use of “mind technologies,” such as the
aforementioned holographic inserts or forced matrix transplants. These
devices can “scramble the memory imprints” held within the body,
creating the emergence of “cover memories”— abductions that are
“cloaked in human form.” Memories of alleged past abuse may first
emerge, involving humans known or unknown to the individual. There will
be some fuzziness of remembered perception in these cases, or
sequentially incorrect memory fragments. By looking deeper, beyond the
apparent human drama, actual memory of the abduction event will arise.
The “body talk” techniques work especially well in these cases, because
the body awareness will not release to the conscious mind data that it
is not yet ready to assimilate. If the body senses through its own
reasoning facilities that the personality is not ready to effectively
deal with the experience, it will not release the memory in its true
form. However, if the body is asked by a well meaning facilitator, it
will reveal information about the nature of the emerging memories and
whether it is using cover memories to disguise actual events. In forced
abductions, not only has the memory been potentially manipulated by the
abductors, but often the Keylonta Codes within the cellular structure
have been altered. This occurs during the procedures of forced matrix
transplant, when the abductors attempt to disconnect the human from its
organic bioenergetic structure (as described in previous sections) in
order to “plug the human into” an artificial matrix or to disengage the
humans higher senses. The actual cellular codes that serve to store and
organize memory become distorted because of this biological distortion.
Techniques of “body talk” may not be successful as the literal
biochemical relationships within the body have been “short circuited.”
Mental, emotional and physical abnormalities may result from this,
depending upon the degree to which the Keylonta Codes have been altered.
In researching and treating cases of abduction, it is important that you
learn to distinguish between the types of intrusion, for the appropriate
treatment will depend upon the category of abduction. Not only will you
need to be able to diagnose the difference between a non-abduction or
abduction, and a forced or consented abduction, you will need to know
whether the forced abduction involved only cover memories and
holographic inserts or whether a forced matrix transplant was attempted
or carried out. Though you can successfully treat the symptoms of the
other forms of abduction, restore memory and assist the conscious mind
to assimilate the event, thereby removing the cause of the disturbing
symptoms, in cases where forced matrix transplant is involved you will
not be able to resolve the issues without bringing the Soul Matrix into
play. In these cases you are best to refer your client to those who are
skilled in multi-dimensional communication and inter-dimensional
manipulation, for these intuitive skills will be required if healing is
to take place. The subject of healing from forced matrix transplants is
beyond the scope of this transmission. Using techniques of hypnosis,
biofeedback and “body talk,”11 you can discern whether an abduction has
taken place, and if so, what type of abduction you are dealing with.
Because it is the symptoms of emotional or psychological disturbance
that bring the possibility of abduction to your attention, and because
Visitor abduction is now at epidemic proportions among the people in
your times (especially within certain geographical locations) you would
be wise to devise screening techniques as mandatory preliminary
evaluation prior to any psychiatric endeavor. Just because you do not
yet hear about abductions on a regular basis does not mean that they are
not occurring within massive portions of the population. They are, but
repression of conscious memory of the event is a symptom characteristic
of the abduction. Often the first indication that such intrusion has
occurred is the manifestation of psychological, emotional or behavioral
deviation, as the personality and subconscious facility attempt to
assimilate the emotional trauma of the experience. If you knew how many
problems of manic depression, substance abuse, neurosis, psychosis, and
many other physiological disorders can be directly traced to Visitor
abduction you would be truly amazed.12 Visitor abduction cases must be
handled differently than non-abduction cases if healing is to be
achieved, as suppression of the symptoms will only worsen the condition.
Unlike other forms of psychological disease that result from the
repression of traumatic experience, abduction reactions cannot simply be
“drugged out of awareness” or circumvented. Most trauma of terrestrial
experience is isolated around certain key memories from the past. The
events that caused the trauma in the first place are no longer a part of
the present moment reality of the individual—the events are not
reoccurring. This is not the case with abduction. All abductions begin
in childhood, as the human is prepared on the subconscious levels for
manipulations that will occur as the body matures. There are no
exceptions. Not all subjects will find the full sequence of memory
dating back to the childhood events, but most will. The abductions are
performed in scheduled fashion following cycles inherent to the
dimensional portal systems, and to the intrinsic cycles of development
within the human. They reoccur within a certain preset time schedule.
Once abduction has been initiated it will continue, following the
cycles, throughout the life span of the individual. Repression and
suppression of the earlier abductions will only serve to intensify the
buildup of the emotional imprint around the experience, creating further
imbalances within the body and mind. The only cure for the
post-traumatic stress symptoms that are the result of Visitor abductions
is the retrieval and assimilation of the experience into the conscious
awareness, and providing a framework of understanding along with an
effective course of action for the personality. These will allow for the
abductee to face the fear of the unknown, and to become empowered,
realizing that certain actions will promote less traumatic experiences
that can be understood by the individual. The individual will no longer
feel powerless over the experience, nor become trapped within the
emotions of fear, anger, apprehension and rage that result from being
disempowered. Healing can occur, through which the abduction experience
may become viewed as an opportunity for learning and growth, rather than
as an intrusion and personal violation. Most abductions are carried out
under the mandates of soul agreements. When humans evolve to a greater
conscious connection with the identity gestalt from which their identity
is created, they will become aware of these agreements and realize that
no violation has occurred, as permission was granted by the individual
on a subconscious level. Through growth understanding will come, and
with understanding peace. In cases of forced abduction, in which these
subconscious agreements were not made, the individual has been violated,
and will benefit, once the true memory has been restored, by therapies
such as those used in treating cases of rape or other personal
victimization. Releasing of the emotional imprint of the trauma and
establishment of effective tools for empowerment for the individual will
promote natural healing as the personality assimilates the experience
over time. In the forced abductions there are methods by which the
individual can prevent further violation, but that subject again is
beyond the scope of this transmission. We will offer insight into this
subject for those who are interested during another transmission. But
the first step to gaining control over the occurrence of forced
abduction is making a valiant effort to create a conscious connection to
your Soul Matrix, within whatever spiritual orientation you are most
comfortable. For your further understanding we will offer to you the
following insights on the abduction experience. As we have mentioned,
abductions are reoccurring and cyclic. There are certain stages of
development of the human biology that are most conducive to the genetic
experimentation being carried out by the Zeta abductors. In human
females, when the hormonal changes associated with adolescence begin,
certain arrangements of the Keylonta Codes within the DNA take place,
which allow for the successful retrieval of the female genetic matter
contained within the egg. For this reason many adolescent females are
being led into disruptive behavior patterns that will serve as a
diversion to the scheduled abductions. Remember, the Zeta possess the
ability to impulse the mental and emotional awareness through the
Keylonta Codes of the body. Great behavioral influence can be applied in
this way, through which the girl can be led into situations and
locations conducive to the abduction. Many (but not all, of course)
teenage runaways, or teens that turn to substance abuse and early
pregnancy are being impulsed to do so by the abductors who silently
watch over them. Most of these adolescents do not understand their
motivations for these behaviors, but may attempt to rationalize away the
seemingly incomprehensible emotional trauma that swims just below their
conscious awareness. We do not mean to frighten you, but teen pregnancy
is a desired event by many of the unenlightened Zeta groups who use
forced abduction tactics. Following pregnancy there are certain
concentrations of energy within the genetic material. This energy in
combination with the already accelerated Keylonta Code activity brought
on by adolescence creates prime genetic material for the Zeta abductors
to use in the creation of their hybrids. Enlightened Zeta who operate
within the confines of soul agreements will never participate in these
events unless they exist as part of the soul agreement. But the
unenlightened Zeta, following the old program, think nothing of
impulsing adolescent females into repeated human pregnancies, as they
utilize these female subjects to harvest the desired genetic imprint.
For this reason we suggest that you offer hypnotic regression therapies
for these young women, so you may discover whether or not this intrusion
is taking place. If memories indicative of abduction are found, bringing
this information into the conscious awareness, and assisting the subject
to assimilate and process the hidden emotional trauma they have been
carrying as a result of the abductions, will allow the young woman to
gain conscious control over her decisions. If she is encouraged to
develop her innate abilities in sensing subtle energies, she can grow to
discern between emotional impulses coming from her own subconscious and
those being transmitted through the manipulation of Zeta abductors. If
you truly desire to assist your populations, you must acknowledge the
reality of the extraterrestrial presence and become familiar with the
tactics that are being using by them—both for you and against you. If
you do not acknowledge the reality of the problem you will not be able
to find solutions. It is time that the human species comes out of the
darkness, and moves out of the denial of the Visitor presence, so that
healing can begin.</p>
<p>The Cellular Alphabet A closing note to your scientists—those who have
been experimenting with electrical impulse as a method to stimulate
brain function. You have recently discovered that you can simulate
abduction- like experiences in people who have not actually experienced
them. First we would like to point out that some of those subjects did
indeed experience actual abductions, but had no conscious memory of the
encounter. You have not properly screened your test subjects prior to
your experiments (using the hypnotic regression techniques mentioned
previously), therefore subjects who did indeed have repressed abduction
memories participated in the experiments, thus contaminating the
apparent results of those experiments. Secondly, yes, you can create
abduction-like experiences (or any other perceptual target) by
electrically or chemically stimulating certain areas of the brain, or
other areas of the body’s neurological or cellular structure. You are
interpreting the results of your present contaminated experiments so as
to indicate that all abductions are false events, representing either
“cover memories,” hallucination-like mental events or outright hoaxes.
Nothing could be further from the truth. Let us say this to you—just
because you are able to simulate an actual event does not mean that the
event cannot exist in organic form. Just because you are able to
simulate abduction-like impressions does not mean that actual abduction
events do not exist, any more than photographing a model of a simulated
spacecraft proves that spaceships do not exist. The fact that you can
recreate or duplicate an effect does not prove nor imply that the
original affect does not occur organically. In regard to brain
manipulation, through electrical or chemical means, you can indeed
create many “false memory” or “virtual reality- like” experiences. At
the present time you are not fully aware of the mechanics of cellular
memory storage and retrieval. Your scientists have failed to realize
that every cell stores not only memory, in the form of coded electrical
impulse, but also stores the very codes of translation, the Keylonta
light-symbol codes. They are the means by which memory is translated
into sensual data and the means by which the illusion of
three-dimensional reality is manufactured. Let us compare these Keylonta
light-symbol codes (or “Fire Letters”) to an alphabet, an alphabet that
is multi-dimensional, and whose characters change placement, meaning and
sound depending upon the dimensional frequency with which they
interface. The Fire Letters of this “alphabet” are stored within every
cell of every human; it is the basis for the human genetic code. Through
this “cellular alphabet” impulses of electromagnetic energy are aligned
and ordered, much as words are formed out of the different letter
combinations of your written alphabet. The words, created out of the
alphabet of letters, are conveyors of meaning. The words and the
alphabet themselves are not the meaning but serve as a conduit through
which meaning can be moved from one place to another. The alphabet then
represents a tool, which creates a medium through which ideas and
perceptions can be shared or projected. Now, in terms of your cellular
alphabet, it too serves as a tool and conveyor of meaning. The Fire
Letters represent fixed electromagnetic codes (patterns of sequentially
arranged electromagnetic impulses) that can be arranged in many ways to
form “words,” or electromagnetic code patterns, that can potentially
carry a wide variety of meanings when put together in specific ways.
Just as a written alphabet holds the potential to convey very simple
meanings or more complex ideas, so does the cellular alphabet have the
potential to convey simple or complex meanings. The cellular alphabet is
designed in a way that allows for many “sentences” to be created at
once. The electromagnetic codes can be arranged in numerous ways
simultaneously to create multi-layered meanings—each “sentence”
“making a statement” in its own right. But when put together with other
“sentences” the elements convey a larger meaning that is “greater than
the sum of its parts.” The cellular alphabet speaks through numerous
languages simultaneously. It is as if the singular alphabet can be used
to create “words and sentences” in French, English, German and Spanish
(as an analogy in our example) all at once, each sentence conveying
meaning to the “people” (or parts of the organism) that happen to speak
that particular language. In the case of human biology, each of your
five known “senses”13 would represent a collective that speaks one of
those languages. All of the senses use the same Fire-Letter alphabet, or
fixed electromagnetic impulse patterns, but each sense translates into
meaning only the “sentences” (strings or sequences of electromagnetic
impulse patterns) that use its natural language. As the biology receives
these electromagnetic “meanings” each sense then further translates that
meaning into other language forms that the conscious human mind can
comprehend. In this way the sense data of your perceptual experience is
brought into your conscious awareness. The senses serve as “language
translators,” translating the sentences from their “native tongue” (the
original electromagnetic impulse sequences that were picked up by the
individual sense facilities) into a form from which your conscious mind
can draw meaning. The visual senses will send the meaning cloaked in
images, the hearing sense will send meaning dressed in sound, and so on
for all of the senses. Each sense sends one aspect of meaning to the
conscious mind via the chemical, hormonal, and neurological systems of
the body all translated into language that the conscious mind can
interpret. These “sentences of meaning” sent by the senses arrive in the
conscious mind simultaneously, creating a collective interpretation of
meaning the human experiences as perceived reality. The meaning of this
reality is “greater than the sum of its parts.” At every step the
translators of the base Fire-Letter alphabet and the Fire-Letter
alphabet itself remain as meaning conveyors only. The meaning flows
through the channels of perception, but the meaning is not “locked
inside of the alphabet” or its “word combinations.” When you stimulate
certain brain areas, such as in the “fake abduction” experiments, you
are manually operating certain random parts of this biological
translation system. (You are also doing this when you use certain
chemicals, and when you are doing “body-work therapy” and therapies that
involve conscious release of cellular memory). The cells that you
stimulate will indeed translate the energy, or electrical impulse you
have sent. The “alphabet” within the cells will translate that impulse
into perceptual data characteristic to the particular electromagnetic
codes or Fire Letters you have randomly chosen. In such experiments it
is as if you randomly “pull letters from the alphabet,” then throw them
on the table and decide that the alphabet is meaningless because you
cannot make coherent “words” out of the “letters” you have chosen. You
are ignoring the rest of the alphabet and the multiple levels of
translation this alphabet undergoes as it synthesizes the multiple
levels of meaning into a cohesive picture of reality. When you stimulate
the brain and create “abduction-like” perceptual experiences, might we
simply suggest that you are accessing part of a translation of a few of
the “alphabet letters.” This in no way proves that other abduction cases
are not real, it only proves that you can stimulate or recreate a
version of that experience through artificial means by activating the
innate cellular alphabet of fixed electromagnetic code patterns. In
actual UFO/Visitor abductions (and during the normal sensory translation
process), the entire alphabet and its translators are used by the Soul
Matrix and body consciousness with purposed intent (or intelligently
directed purpose) and the mechanics of their language are understood by
that intelligence. In these cases the alphabet is used to convey
meaning. The perceptual experience created through the alphabet is not
random and meaningless as it is within your experiments. Your illusion
of three-dimensionally solid matter is created in just the same way, the
only difference is that different “word combinations” (electromagnetic
impulse sequence patterns) are used to carry different meanings. Actual
abduction encounters are no more or less real than is your perceptual
experience of three-dimensional reality. Both involve the translation of
experiential information that organically exists as particle groupings
of electromagnetic energy into symbolic experiential representations of
the reality that exists as energy patterns. We repeat: Your experience
of three-dimensional matter is no more real or valid than the
experiences encountered during actual Visitor abductions. Period. In
essence, both are mental aberrations, “hallucinations,” “holograms” or
cover illusions, created through the mind and body to give you the
perceptual distortion you call three- dimensional reality. This reality
is really energy at its core, regardless of what guise that energy
wears. Your three-dimensional system seems quite real to you, and
Visitors abductions are presently an intrinsic part of that system.
Visitor abduction experiences and the experience of three- dimensionally
solid matter are both translations of energy reality as perceived
through the Keylontic code structures of the human organism. Both are
illusions. But both are quite literal and real. To accurately categorize
Visitor abductions as “not real but imagined” you would have to place
your three-dimensionally viewed world into the same category. We are
suggesting that you could be of far more assistance to yourselves, and
to those who come to you for understanding regarding abductions, if you
were to stop viewing the experiences as invalid or as indications of
mental imbalance. In abduction-related cases that involve mental
imbalance it is usually the abduction that created the condition, not
the imbalance creating the illusion of an abduction. People having
abduction experiences usually are not mentally ill, they are “ordinary
people having extraordinary experiences.” Mental illness can however
result, in some cases, from the trauma of a repressed, undiagnosed or
“botched” Visitor abduction. As we have said before, you would be
literally amazed (and most of you terribly frightened) by the number of
“patients” in your mental hospitals and under psychiatric care for
seemingly “typical or clinical” disorders, who are in actuality the
victims of undiagnosed abductions. The mental disorders manifest as a
perfectly “normal” personality tries to comprehend and assimilate an
experience for which it has no logical framework. Conditions ranging
from psychosis to “split-personality syndrome” and even suicide can
manifest as the abductee faces an inner terror for which there is
seemingly no explanation. But we must stress that there is an
explanation and a cause behind many of your apparent mental disorders
—the cause is quite often Visitor abduction. To those of you in the
medical and psychiatric communities, if you truly care about the welfare
of your patients, we urge you to quickly implement screening techniques
(as mentioned earlier in this section) to diagnose the probability, not
just the possibility, as abduction affects hundreds of thousands of your
people globally—even in cases that appear to be “typical or “clinical”
disorders—screening is an invaluable tool. For if Visitor abduction is
the cause behind the disorder, traditional modes of treatment will be
ineffective in the long run! And using drug therapy to disguise the
symptoms will only create a chemical dependence within the body, that
will make later memory retrieval therapies more difficult to implement.
You should also screen those already diagnosed with most “typical
disorders,” as true healing of those victimized by abduction can only
occur through proper diagnosis and memory retrieval and assimilation
therapies. If you care about your people you will begin to develop these
screening techniques now and to implement them as soon as possible.
People experiencing Visitor abduction do need treatment, and treatment
begins with personal respect. Labeling such individuals as “freaks” or
viewing them as “mental cases” only keeps you blind and it harms them
rather than healing them. There are many well meaning health
practitioners who genuinely care about their patients, and to you we say
“please have the courage to open your minds to the possibilities we have
suggested and begin the intelligent research that is needed. Speak out
about your findings and your feelings, on behalf of professional
integrity and on behalf of your patients. Open your heart to those who
come to you with abduction “stories.” Learn to listen and learn to
learn. For it is the abductees themselves that will bring to you the
information you need to help those victims who are unaware of these
events that haunt them on subconscious levels. Use your wisdom to find
those who are presently unaware of their abduction experiences as
awareness is the first step toward healing. And we suggest that you
begin with yourselves, for many of you are also abductees who have yet
to remember. Dig for those memories that are harbored within your bodies
and souls and you may indeed discover the existence of that soul. Learn
to diagnose and treat others by first diagnosing yourselves, and treat
others with the respect and compassion that you yourselves would demand.
A whole new world now awaits your exploration.” And now a final bit of
information concerning abductees: We are addressing those of you in the
scientific and medical communities not only to inform you of the
existence of the abduction experience but also to inform you that
you—the doctors, scientists, clergy, “experts” within many fields, as
well as the “common man”— are being abducted on a regular basis. Even
if you may scoff at the possibility and have no memory of the
encounters. The enlightened Zeta are now working with you, abducting you
in order to train you and in order to teach you things you have not yet
dreamed exist. These abductions are those of the “agreement” kind (as
previously discussed) and you are treated with great respect. No harm
will come to you other than the harm you might do to yourselves in
trying to deny the experiences or in resisting the visitation should you
become aware during the event. You are being trained in knowledge that
will help your people and your world. You are being trained through
abduction visitations and in your dreams. Ask yourself sometime, “Where
do my thoughts come from?” And before you rationalize away the
possibilities, make certain that all of those thoughts belong to you.
For the Visitors know the human mind from the “inside out” and are quite
able to direct you through the impulses of your own brain wave patterns.
These professional communities we have mentioned presently represent the
highest percentage of humans who are being abducted. And you, within
those communities are the most prepared to conduct yourselves rationally
in the face of the unknown. That is why you are selected, why you are
part of a select group (which does involve some other non-professional
citizens) known as the chosen ones. You will be allowed to remember when
you are ready to handle that memory wisely, and then your abductions
will no longer be abductions, but instead conscious visitations. All
abductees and the scientists who study them are being confronted with
experiences they must grow to understand, and with a very real
experiential language that neither are yet prepared to decipher that
preparation is to come. The meaning and purpose of the abduction
experience lives within its translation, but the meaning will be lost to
you if you do not understand the “language” through which it comes. When
you look at a tree in your reality you “see a tree” and assume that
image is its only reality. You are so accustomed to “seeing trees” that
you do not question whether or not what you are perceiving is an
aberration or hallucination. You accept the reality of the tree without
question. Yet when you see a little grey being with big dark eyes, you
begin to question your sanity. Perhaps you have been taught to believe
in trees but not in ETs?  In its true reality, the tree is not as you
perceive it at all. It exists as glowing patterns of light geometries,
energy oscillations and sound emanations. That is the true reality of a
tree or any other object or being within your three-dimensional system.
However, its solidity is apparent, and its solid reality is validated
when that pattern of energy is viewed through the energy patterns you
call the human body. Thus it is safe to say that the solid tree
represents one aspect of the tree’s reality. It is one form that the
tree takes within the full pattern of its wholeness. The solid tree is
no more real or unreal than any of its other aspects. All of them
together are tree. So too is it the same for little grey ETs and
spaceships and Visitors from other places. All exist as conscious energy
patterns, and when perceived through the energy patterns you call the
human body, the patterns appear as little grey ETs, spaceships and
Visitors from other places. Or perhaps the energy patterns will appear
as mountains, oceans or people walking around in three-dimensional human
bodies. The experience of the little grey Visitor, the tree or the human
and its three- dimensional world represent one aspect of a reality and
identity that is multidimensional. By the way, if you stumble upon and
stimulate the appropriate cells within the human organism, you can make
people see trees also. Does this mean that all trees are figments of
your imagination? That is a very loaded question. Welcome, dear ones, to
the science of the subconscious symbol codes, part of the reality
construction system we refer to as Keylonta Mechanics. We will offer
more on these mechanics in other transmissions. Until then, happy
decoding to all of you, and may your journey to understanding reap many
rewards! Suaehenatunaz Rhanthunkeana Matrix Ranthia Transmittance
