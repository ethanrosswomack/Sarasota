          <p>Chapter 3: Human Origins and Hybridization</p>
<p>Hybrids In order to learn more about alien abductions you must first
realize that in most reported cases the events are quite real and
deserve validation. Quite literally you have been taught, or programmed,
to “not believe in aliens.” The mainstream view still sees the idea of
ET life as a joke or product of romantic fantasy. Once upon a time in
your history the masses viewed airplanes in the same way. Once upon a
time only “lunatics” believed the Earth was round. It is time for
individuals to begin looking beyond the small scope of their global
reality and begin wondering of what greater community might it be a
part. Your governments and sciences have been manipulated into debunking
and invalidating abduction and UFO sightings experiences by the very
beings whose reality they proclaim does not exist. The Zeta and others
would like to see humans remain ignorant to their activities, for in so
doing they can direct humans in any way they choose. Some Zeta factions
are still involved in creating a hybrid race whose ultimate purposes
would be to compete with humans for the Earth and her resources. These
hybrids already exist, but their strain is not quite strong enough,
their masses still too few. If this experiment was to progress
unchecked, these beings would misuse the resources of the Earth and
violate its inherent integrity, much as the Zeta have violated the
integrity of the humans they study. For this reason, and the potential
future consequences within the third dimension, there is much assistance
being offered to humans, and to the Zeta themselves, for finding better
solutions. The greatest threat to Earth and to human life at this time
is not a “pole reversal,” self- imposed nuclear holocaust, depletion of
natural resources or over population. The greatest threat to your well
being is that of manipulation and exploitation by forces that you do not
even yet know are real. The Zeta have successfully interbred with human
females. There are hybrid babies and children, or what would appear as
Zeta- human hybrids if they were within the three-dimensional system.
They do appear as such when they are brought into the third dimension to
have contact with their human mothers. The hybrids presently cannot
enter the third dimension fully; their biology is not yet adjusted to
the concentrations of matter density within which the third dimension is
cloaked. They originate from and exist within an adjacent dimensional
band of Earth. The Zeta are cultivating them within those coordinates,
not within the present coordinates of your three-dimensional Earth
structure. The hybrids are being cultivated to engage in an intersection
with your Earth at a time point 400 to 500 years in your future. There
are various strains of these Zeta-human hybrid beings, each designed to
fulfill certain roles within the Zeta plan. Some appear as large, thin
white beings with wispy hair, usually white in color when in maturity.
These represent the first-born strain of the race, and these possess the
capacity to understand human emotion, as you understand it, better than
the more sophisticated strains that have emerged from them. They are the
“closest to human” in terms of biology and psychological orientation.
Other strains have been sighted in your times during abductions. The
small, dwarf-like creatures you call the blues and also the browns are
hybrids, but they were specifically created as the “worker” strain.
These are not simply Zeta-human hybrids, but represent a conglomeration
of genetic material derived from other dimensional species as well as
from human DNA. Unlike the Zeta-human hybrids the blues and browns do
not possess a high degree of intellectual or intelligence capacity, nor
do they harbor within their gene structure a large scope of evolutionary
probabilities. They are linked through a hierarchy of centralized minds
and are “programmed” or contoured to serve the needs of those higher up
on the evolutionary scale. These beings will often be found in proximity
to the whites (the Zeta-human hybrids), serving as guards or general
soldiers.</p>
<p>Zionites Many experiments continue to be carried out within the Zeta
factions, some combining Earth animal aspects with Zeta and other
dimensional life forms. There is one other category of Zeta created
hybrids that we would like to mention. These represent the highest
strain and they are also conglomerates, created through the genetic
fusing of Zeta, humans and other dimensional ET life forms. We have
mentioned previously the mantis-like beings called the Aethien The
Aethien being highly evolved teachers commissioned to assist the Zeta,
the humans and many others through out your dimension and others. The
Aethien have agreed to assist those Zeta who have made a commitment to
non-violation of other systems. The Aethien offered their expertise and
some of their genetic material to assist the Zeta in continuation of
their species through genetic mutation. Out of this agreement yet
another strain of hybrid was formed, the Zeta human- Aethien strain that
we refer to as the Zionites.The Zionite strain constitutes a master race
of beings whose abilities and powers reach far beyond the present moment
of your Earth history. Indeed, this race was created by “splicing
together” the best of the human strain with other highly advanced
genetic material from other systems. The Zeta drew genetic material from
the distant past of your species, and they also sent matured hybrids
back in time to directly interact with humans. The past we speak of
involves advanced civilizations that existed in your past historically
but of which you presently have no record. The Zionites are cultivated
time travelers. Though their species came into being through the genetic
experimentation of the Zeta in conjunction with the Aethien, their
strain is unique in its abilities of maneuverability through time. From
their points of origin in a dimension of Earth adjacent to your own, and
running along a time continuum parallel to that of your present, the
Zionites have fanned outward in time within your third dimension and
also within other dimensions. There are planets within your universe
upon which Zionites can be found, and there are large groupings of them
working with the Aethien in their home systems. Though in your present
terms they could be considered a “fledgling race,” you must realize that
(because of their inter-time abilities) they are also a fully matured
race simultaneously. They exist as a part of your future in your
three-dimensional world, but they are also a part of your past. Through
the Zionites involvement with your ancestors they are also part of your
heritage as humans, and they have had a tremendous effect upon the
development of your species.</p>
<p>Turaneusiam Prior to your recorded history there did exist upon the
Earth civilizations of humans that would be considered superior
genetically to your present human strain. These beings had interaction
with others “from the stars” in your terms. The original human prototype
contained genetic materials gathered throughout the galaxy. The human
prototype was not of Earth in its original construction. Humans
originated on Earth’s fifth-dimensional counterpart planet Tara. The
Zionites were one of the “star groups” whose genetic material was
supplied to create the original human prototype. The race of humans of
which we speak is called the Turaneusiam. Their biologies emerged 560
million years ago (YA) from combining various species of animal-like
life forms indigenous to Tara during those times with other, more
advanced genetic strains from other planetary and other dimensional
systems. Tara was viewed as a “nursery” of sorts, where this new human
hybrid could develop and gain sovereignty over the life forms upon the
Tara. The human prototype was intended to become the custodian and
guardian of Tara, and to enjoy open intergalactic and interdimensional
exchange with many other civilizations. For a period of time this
development occurred and the new species (humans) evolved graciously.
There came a point in time however in which the species began a path of
de-evolution. The humans (Turaneusiam) began interbreeding with the
other indigenous life forms. Their genetic strain became more and more
animal-like, which progressively reduced their ability to carry the
higher intelligence for which they were intended. The species digressed,
falling into more and more behaviors characteristic of the less
developed life forms. Some of the humans left Tara and joined with their
interstellar brothers. Others remained upon Tara while genetic diversity
began to fragment the human species. Many attempts of reeducation were
made by the cultures who had seeded the original prototype, but the
digression became too great. The humans who had originally been intended
as Tara’s guardians were losing the ability to fulfill that role. The
Turaneusiam had originally possessed great power and knowledge. As the
genetic digression continued distortions in their knowledge began to
manifest in instinctual behaviors, within which abuse and misuse of
power was prevalent. Tara’s resources and other life forms were more and
more abused and misused. The creators of the Turaneusiam, after a
millennium of attempted reeducation, finally decided to allow the
species to continue its digression into its natural end—the
self-termination of the species, which nearly occurred during events of
550 million years ago. The prototype was preserved through those
Turaneusiam who had retreated underground or resettled in other systems
within the three-dimensional universe. The legends now common in your
culture involving Atlantis and Lemuria have emerged through the genetic
memory into your times from that prehistoric reality. Though “Atlantis”
was not the actual name of this civilization the drama your legends
associate with it are actual translations of some of the events that
occurred during this period of original human creation.</p>
<p>Twelve Tribes Several thousand years again passed during which time
there were periods of relative stability and instability as Tara
rebalanced and realigned its magnetic grid. During this cycle it was
decided by the creators of the Turaneusiam that yet another experiment
would be tried —they would again seed their humans, this time into the
Earth system. This time it would be done more slowly—the genetic
imprint of the original prototype would be broken down into sections or
sub-imprints. Each imprint would be used to create a “smaller”
prototype, or subspecies of the original Turaneusiam. The genetic
package was broken down into twelve units, each containing two primary
attributes of the original pattern. The original pattern possessed
twelve strands of DNA. The twelve were separated into individual
packages and then polarized. Each of the twelve sub-species was assigned
on a genetic level to re-bundle their polarized strand into one complete
unit. As each of the twelve groups of beings or tribes overcame the
duality coded within its genetic structure, it would be brought into
alignment with the tribes that had done the same. Through this process
the human genetic strain would, over time, evolve into the wholeness of
its original pattern. The digressive elements that were mutated into the
strain from its animal interbreeding would slowly be mutated out,
leaving behind the pure code of the human prototype. It was and is a
plan that would take several hundred-thousand years to complete, if the
species was able to evolve rather than fall into de-evolution once more.
Your Biblical stories of origins and of the flood emerged out of this
drama. The “fall” in Biblical terms represents the digression brought on
by animal interbreeding, the resulting mutation of form, and the
cataclysmic events that nearly terminated the species 550 million years
ago. The version of that story popular in your times has been twisted
and contrived away from its original symbolic meaning. The “flood”
within your story represents the period of time when the twelve
sub-species of humans were reseeded upon the Earth. The Sodom and
Gomorrah drama is a retranslation of the “Atlantean/Lemurian” events
that occurred on Tara before the flood, these two elements being
combined into a new version carrying the same theme but restructuring
the time context. “Adam” and “Eve” were symbolic personages representing
the polarization of the sub-strands of DNA and the birth of duality of
consciousness. The symbolic story of Adam and Eve was itself twisted
from its true meaning, which in allegorical form stood for the
polarization of the twelve single strands of the subspecies. Your
version promotes the idea that “Eve was created out of the rib of Adam,”
which symbolically implies that man was created first. The polarization
of the DNA, and the resulting birth of duality of gender, occurred
simultaneously. It further encourages you to believe that woman was
created to serve man, to be “lesser” and to play a subservient role.
These distortions were purposely given to you to keep from you and
suppress the power and wisdom held within the female form and
consciousness. Through this distortion the polarities or duality within
each of the twelve sub-species could never be overcome, and thus the
completion of human evolution into its original exalted form could never
be actualized. Just as the original creators of the human prototype
desired to see the fulfillment of the species as guardians of the Earth
and Tara there also exist forces of great power that do not wish this
plan to succeed. If humans are able to fulfill their evolutionary
blueprint, the Earth and many other reality fields will no longer be
free for exploitation. They will become protected by a species equal in
power and greater in knowledge than those who wish to misuse these
realities. It is from this interdimensional conflict that your concepts
of “good vs. evil” and “God vs. devil” emerge. One group of advanced
beings wish to see humans evolve into wholeness, equality and
co-creatorship, while another group of beings desires to stunt the
evolution of humanity so it can continue to utilize its resources for
self serving purposes. The latter group has come to represent the dark
or evil forces within the collective human unconscious, while the former
has emerged into your mythologies of the gods. Because of this “cosmic
conflict” so to speak, attempts have been made by both sides throughout
your history to train the evolving humans. One set of teachings will
lead humans to evolve, the other to digress. The ploy of distorting the
helpful teachings has been used repeatedly throughout your species
development by the forces that do not wish you to succeed. Much of your
present teachings are so contaminated by these distortions that the true
meaning of the original teachings has been lost, or applied in a way
that creates the opposite effect for which the teachings were originally
intended. During your recorded history much information was given to
assist humanity’s development. Your speculations about ancient
astronauts bringing knowledge and technological advancements to Earth
cultures are quite accurate. This method of assisting your culture was
indeed employed often in your historical development. Certain cultures
were able to interact directly with the travelers from other systems.
One such group is the ancient Egyptians, another is the Melchizedeks,
the group that has fragmented to become those affiliated with the
Christian and Jewish faiths. The predecessors of your Celtic and Druid
lineages also had involvement with interstellar teachers, as did many
others. At one time or another the teachers interacted with all human
sub-groups, helping to form the basis for their mythologies and creation
stories, their psychologies and their technologies. The group of
teachers we would like you to become familiar with are the
aforementioned Zionites The Silicate Matrix The Zionites interacted
directly with your ancient Egyptian cultures, and prior to this they
were heavily involved with Sumerian culture. Not only were these
cultures gifted with knowledge but they were also imbued with the gift
of interstellar seeding. Zionites would often interbreed with the
humans, adding the potentialities of their genetic code into that of the
evolving humans. Certain groups of these “special” humans were seeded,
and that genetic seed was dispersed among the races through further
interbreeding within the twelve human tribes. The Zionites traveled back
in time giving to your species the code of transmutation. We refer to
this “genetic package” imbued by the Zionites as the Silicate Matrix or
the Crystal Gene. The Silicate Matrix contains the original
twelve-strand DNA code structure of the original Taran-human prototype
(the Turaneusiam). It presently exists within a number of humans as a
latent genetic code sequence that must be brought into activation. Once
activated, it allows for the progressive transmutation of form. Not all
humans carry this code, and not all code carriers can endure full
activation, but those who carry this matrix (contained within the
cellular material you currently call junk DNA) have the potential
ability of accelerated evolution. They possess within their genetic
makeup the latent ability to transmute cellular structure, which will
one day allow them to traverse the time portals and interdimensional
passageways without deterioration of their biological form. Though there
are other teaching races that have had similar involvement with the
human populace, none of these possessed the genetic combinations needed
to allow for this advancement in human biology. Those carrying this
strain have a predisposition to multidimensional perception,
interdimensional communication and UFO abductions of the Soul agreement
kind. The Zionites are working from your future as well as from your
past, leading their chosen ones to the fulfillment of their genetic
imprint, through which these humans will assist in setting the codes for
the advanced evolution of the species. Though the Zeta were in part
responsible for the creation of this master race, many of them now live
in fear of them. Their “children” became far more wise and powerful than
the Zeta themselves, and went on to join interstellar groups far beyond
the scope of the Zeta’s perceptions. Those Zeta who bring harm or
violation to humans, and who have not agreed to work in brotherhood find
themselves up against a formidable adversary. The Zeta working toward
peace view them with respectful awe. There will be a time in your Earth
future when direct contact with the Zionites is orchestrated. Many of
the abduction experiences in your present time are geared toward
assisting the human populace in preparing for that encounter. This
future event is the purpose behind the genetic experiments presently
being carried out by the Zeta, Aethien and humans with soul agreements.
The hybrid human- Zeta beings, (“whites,” “blues,” “browns” and others),
serve an instrumental role in making that introduction successful.</p>
<p>Human Hybrid Pregnancies Human females that have subconscious soul
agreements to provide the human egg required to foster the hybrid embryo
most often do not remember their abductions. These mothers have a
genetic code that would not permit them to engage in interdimensional
transmigration. They fit into the group whose biologies would be
destroyed by such activity. They do not carry the gene of transmutation
(Silicate Matrix or “Crystal Gene”) from the earlier Zionite encounters.
The eggs from such women are used to create the “whites,” as previously
mentioned. Male sperm is also used to create a variation of this strain.
The “whites” cannot interact fully with the three-dimensional system for
any prolonged period of time. These human females are the egg donors,
but will not have the experience of pregnancy in regard to the
abductions. Most of them will never remember their encounters with alien
forms consciously, but most will if techniques such as hypnosis are
employed. Usually the trauma of the experience registers on an emotional
level where it then becomes buried within the symbol codes. Some
instances of these experiences emerge to the woman as recall of sexual
abuse or violation, where the psyche then puts on cover memories
creating a form of “false memory” of childhood or adolescent assault.
The trauma is real and has occurred, but it is “cloaked in human
clothing” so to speak. Not all cases of repressed-memory sexual assault
are due to abductions, but many can be attributed to such encounters.
Instances in which the physical facts and circumstances of the alleged
assault do not easily coincide with actual historical aspects of the
case can be a clue for investigators to look deeper into the possibility
of alien abduction. Some women donors are being used by Zeta that are
not in cooperation with the peaceful brotherhoods. These abductees
experience violation at the hands of their abductors and are often used
repeatedly for their services. The more frequently the abductions occur
in these cases the closer to conscious recall will be the memory of the
experience. Most women experiencing donor abductions do so under the
contract of soul agreements. They may feel violated until the actual
memory and agreement has been brought into conscious awareness. Hypnosis
by skilled practitioners can be therapeutic in either case, but
validation of the experience is necessary if healing is to take place.
Donor abductions are only one form of encounter presently experienced by
humans. Women who have the abduction experience of missing fetuses or
vanishing pregnancies fall into another category. These women are not
simply “egg donors” but serve as surrogate mothers for another version
of the “white” hybrid. Women who have been selected to carry an embryo
or fetus are those who carry some trace of the Silicate Matrix within
their latent genetic code. Their bodies are able to endure some degree
of transmutation, even if it is only the small amount of acceleration in
body vibrational rates needed to accommodate the hybrid fetus. Like the
donors, these women usually experience abductions that take place within
the third-dimensional field, in which holographic inserts, perceptual
interference and “cover memories” are utilized to distort or block
memory of the event. However, because of the trace of the Silicate
Matrix within their gene code they are able to sustain the beginnings of
pregnancy involving a hybrid fetus. The hybrid fetus develops in its
early weeks and months in the same way as the human fetus would mature.
It carries a slightly higher cellular oscillation rate than that of a
human, but this difference is so minute that the fetus would appear to
you as no different than that of a human. As the fetus develops certain
vibrational patterns within the genetic base code begin to change,
making the fetal pattern more and more incompatible with the body
resonance of its host. At some point the fetus must be removed and
transferred to another dimensional frequency where its development can
progress. Mothers who have carried such pregnancies, only to find their
fetuses missing, have undergone such fetal transplant in order to
protect the integrity of their own bodies as well as to secure the
development of the fetus. It would help for these women to know that the
children are not being stolen from them. If the hybrid fetus were
allowed to mature within its human host either the mother’s body would
miscarry the fetus, treating it as “foreign material,” or more often,
the fetus itself, in its thrust for life, would quickly deplete the body
and energy of the mother. Only Hybrid fetuses are ever taken, those
produced through human conception are never used in relation to the
enlightened Zeta (“Stealing human fetuses” is not a tactic often
employed by the abusive Zeta factions either, as their interests move in
other directions.) Carrying the hybrid fetus beyond the first trimester
(or slightly into the second trimester in rare cases) would disrupt the
hormonal balances within the female. Muscle tissue would rapidly
deteriorate, as would bone structure and certain vital elements within
the bone marrow. The developing fetus would act as a cancer within the
woman’s body, rapidly destroying cellular integrity. The hybrid fetus is
hardy, the human body of its host far more fragile, so the continuation
of a pregnancy involving the hybrid would end the life of its mother.
Great care is taken during soul agreement abductions to protect both
fetus and host. The duration of these pregnancies is a clue to the
degree to which the Silicate Matrix has been found present within the
mother’s genetic code. The longer pregnancies imply a greater presence
of this trace gene and thus a greater ability on the part of the mother
to engage in interdimensional transmutation. Mothers involved in the
longer gestations are those often taken later to visit with their hybrid
offspring. Having the Silicate Matrix present within their genetic
structures allows for the mothers to undergo the dimensional
transmigration necessary for such visitations to take place. As infants
or children none of the whites can be brought into the third dimension
for any period of time without suffering potentially irreversible damage
to their biological structures. For this reason visitations are arranged
“between dimensions” or within certain contrived “frequency modulation
zones,” whereas the human mother and hybrid child can meet within a
temporarily neutral atmosphere. Though visitation with the human mother
is usually in the best interest of the child’s development, the meetings
are arranged only when to do so would also benefit rather than
traumatize the mother. As more human surrogates learn of what is taking
place within their abduction experiences and “make peace with the
process” so to speak, more mother/hybrid-child visitations will be
offered. Women abductees who feel they are ready can request such a
visitation by making their desire known just prior to sleep. The
visitation may take place during the dream state or another “consented
abduction” arranged in which the mother’s wishes can be carried out. The
enlightened Zeta have no desire to create trauma for human females, and
they are willing to assist these women in understanding the purposes
behind their encounters. The women must take the initiative in this
regard, and let their Zeta acquaintances know they are receptive to such
communication and contact. Again, requesting contact prior to sleep or
during practice of meditation or focused solitude are the most effective
methods of communicating this intention. Abductees are continuously
monitored by the Zeta and the request will be observed and acted upon if
appropriate to the needs of the woman. Male humans have also
participated in this interbreeding and many have progeny within the race
of whites. It is rare, however, that visitation between human father and
hybrid child is arranged, as human males tend to react more aggressively
and exhibit less receptivity toward peaceful contact. The males usually
have less biological bonding with the child, as they have not had the
opportunity to feel its life within their biology. (We notice that many
human males exhibit this same lack of bonding toward their own human
progeny, whereas they often do not feel the emotional connection to
their children as readily as their female counterparts.) Human males
tend to view children as the propagation of lineage, taking the
possessive stance of authority over them rather than viewing their
children as individuals with whom they are to build sustaining emotional
bonds. Such bonding usually takes place later in life, after the child
has grown, if it takes place at all. Not all men view their children in
such a way, and many more emotionally aware males are quite able to
establish bonds with their offspring, even from conception. These more
matured males are more likely to be offered the opportunity to visit
their hybrid progeny than are those who exhibit bonding difficulty or
overly possessive attitudes toward their children. Many women share
these attitudes as well—we are not simply “picking on” the males of
your species. But because human women have developed a greater emotional
sensitivity, as a general rule within your culture, (because of the
gender-related beliefs prevalent in your times) the women are more often
able to cultivate attitudes that are more accepting, trusting and
conducive to nurturing. There are exceptions in either case, and
“attitude is everything” when it comes to parental visitation between
human parent and hybrid offspring.</p>
<p>Borentulisum The hybrid whites created through fetal transplant have the
ability to enter into the three-dimensional frequency bands for short
periods of time. They carry a stronger human imprint than those derived
from egg-donor conceptions, which allows for certain advantages. These
beings possess the strongest emotional imprint of the hybrids and are
thus better able to understand, interact and utilize telepathic
communications with humans. They will one day serve the role of
intermediaries when Zionite contact is made with the human populace.
They will also serve as teachers and helpers to those humans who agree
to assist in the accelerated evolution of the human species. The hybrid
whites born of fetal transplant, who are capable of limited
interdimensional transmutation and transmigration are referred to as the
Borentulisum (bor en thul’ is um). Those whites born of egg donation and
non-biological insemination, who cannot usually endure interdimensional
transport are known as the Borentasai (bor en’ thas i). Both hybrid
strains are highly intelligent, with a strong mathematical leaning and
great ability to comprehend the workings of universal physics and
advanced sciences built upon that comprehension. Both represent pure
strains of Human-Zeta hybrids, those two races being the only
contributors to their genetic makeup. Their base strain was formulated
out of the genetic materials of the “little grey” Zeta and the human
genetic imprint, used in various combinations. (Other Zeta- human hybrid
strains utilizing the Zephelium-Zeta genetic code are presently being
constructed.) Both strains of the Borendt (bor en’), (as they are called
collectively), have the ability to link minds directly with human
contactees, using the aforementioned Keylonta Codes. They are thus able
to interact with humans during the human dream state or during times of
altered states of consciousness, such as those that occur when
practicing certain meditation techniques. Often they will leave “pre-
recorded” imprints, packages of communicated data in electrical form,
within the base codes of the human DNA, that will one day be retrieved
by the human and translated into conscious communication or cognition.
For those humans who are ready and able to receive such communications
directly the Borendt are willing to begin sharing information and
creating conscious relationships. They can be trusted, as you will not
find the Borendt present with Zeta groups who are working in violation
of the human species. On the rare occasions that Borendt accompany
unenlightened Zeta, they are either held captive via mind control or
work covertly as guardian infiltrates, in either case they hold
pro-human sympathies at heart. The Borendt were created out of your
lineage, and are aware of this fact, and so they view the human race
with great compassion and a parental sense of responsibility. One day
they will be welcomed and respected among those humans working toward
universal brotherhood. The Borendt have much to teach your race, skills
and knowledge that you need to make your evolution easier and more
fulfilling, both for the individual and the masses. We would like you to
understand that the Zeta are not “evil monsters” desiring to destroy or
misuse humanity. Rather, they are a fragmented race, many of whom live
in fear of extinction—a race trying to create solutions for themselves
using the only methods they possess. As is the case within the human
species, some Zeta are more aware, enlightened and spiritually mature
than others. The groups bringing harm to humans are guilty of the crime
of ignorance. They do not believe non-invasive methods of interspecies
cooperation exist. They have observed that humans quite often cannot
treat even those of their own kind with compassion, understanding and
tolerance, so they have little faith in the idea that a cooperative
relationship could be developed between the species. The Zeta factions
working against a positive human evolution believe they must take what
they need before it is taken from them. The resources of Earth, upon
which they are progressively coming to depend, are viewed as the subject
of interspecies competition, and humans as the objects or obstacles that
need to be overcome to protect their interest in Earth’s resources. They
do not really understand the human emotional reactions of pain and anger
that so often meet them. They do not understand that in “neutralizing
their competitors” they are violating human reality and spiritual
integrity, any more than many humans understand how they have plundered
their indigenous plant and animal kingdoms that “stood in the way” of
human progress. To the unenlightened Zeta, humans stand in the way of
their progress toward cultivating alternatives to their pending
extinction. They have a “vested interest” in the development of Earth,
so to speak. It would be very helpful to the human experience if you
were to view these unenlightened Zeta as fellow beings, facing some of
the same challenges your species faces, rather than seeing them as
potential enemies with whom you must do battle. You are not equipped,
technologically or mentally, to do battle with the Zeta. Such endeavors
would prove fruitless to your race at best. The unenlightened Zeta, as
well as the unenlightened humans need to grow, to develop concepts that
promote brotherhood and cooperation rather than segregation and
competition. They need to be taught a better way, by example.
Enlightened humans have a responsibility not only to their own species
but also toward those within other species, be they the plant and animal
forms indigenous to Earth or the visitors from elsewhere who come to
Earth as they evolve within their own line of development. We will
explore the Zeta-human relationship more fully as our writings progress.</p>
