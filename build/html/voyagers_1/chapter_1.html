          <p>Chapter 1: UFOs, Visitors, and the
Interior Government</p>
<p>Investigating the UFO We shall begin this discourse with the subject of
UFOs or Unidentified Flying Objects. We are referring here to those
reported sightings of seemingly mechanical-type vessels of transport
that have no apparent terrestrial origin. In this category we shall also
place other airborne phenomena of related characteristics, but those
which lack the elements of mechanical type vestiges. The latter are
usually described as Light Formations, reportedly witnessed both at
close range and great distances. Both types of UFOs have at times
appeared in radar tracking, as well as having many eyewitness reports of
sightings or encounters with such yet unexplained phenomena. Photographs
and film have at times captured images of both types of UFO presence. In
attempting to explain the origins of such phenomena it is necessary to
broach the issue of human physics. Some understanding of the nature of
time, matter and perception is required if sense is to be made of these
events. In regard to the solid object UFOs often witnessed and
documented, suffice it to say that these objects are existing (at the
time of encounter) within the range of perception of three-
dimensionality. That is, these objects are functioning within the same
time-space continuum as other objects within the earth’s objectively
perceivable and measurable reality. So, as our first point of interest,
we shall say that any such three-dimensionally perceivable UFO is (at
the point of encounter) functioning within the laws and mechanics of
physics as your culture presently understands them. Having determined
this obvious fact of corresponding time-space sequence, the next
question to address is that of the origin of the object being perceived.
The question of “what it is” is directly related to the issue of “where
it came from,” for you cannot answer one question without answering the
other. If you desire to elicit intelligent answers as to the nature of
these phenomena, it is necessary to ask intelligent questions. In order
to ask intelligent questions, it is necessary that you expand the
framework of reference out of which these questions are drawn. Official
investigation into the nature of three-dimensional mechanical-type UFO
events centers around explaining these phenomena using the current
premise of scientific thought. The core assumption or root belief within
the scientific dictum is that the objectified Earth field of
three-dimensional reality is the “only real reality that exists.”
Phenomena must be explained within this terrestrial- based scope of
perception. Underlying and interwoven with this core assumption are the
ideas that the human species is the only “real intelligent life form” in
the universe, and that the three-dimensional Earth field of perceivable
reality is the only “real” reality and thus all things must be explained
within the perceivable confines of that reality. In researching UFO
phenomena the officials tend to look for data and correlations that will
prove their own theories and assumptions, rather than investigating the
phenomena as an active reality from which there is knowledge to gain.
More effort is put into disproving the reality of the phenomena than is
applied to investigating what information the phenomena is presenting
that will add to the understanding of how reality works. In regard to
three-dimensional mechanical UFO sightings the first series of
intelligent questions that should be asked involve how the object
behaves in relation to the known laws of physics as they are presently
understood. Does the object exhibit behavior consistent with those laws,
or are there anomalies in its exhibited characteristics that seem to
contradict or push beyond the scope of those “laws” as they are
presently known? If more attention is paid to such questions, the
phenomena themselves would lead researchers to add information to their
present bank of laws. Time, space and perception are intimately
intertwined. Science and physics have already lent credence to the
“theory” that time is not linear in nature as once thought. The
mechanics of quantum physics present a solid argument for the curvature
of time and the possibilities of “times” coexisting in overlay
formation…one sequence of events being superimposed over others and
each functioning within their own “coordinate pattern” or frequency
band. Within these “theories” are the realities that will give your
science the ability to expand its framework of understanding enough to
begin asking the right questions in regard to three-dimensional UFOs. We
are presenting this information to you because it is time for humanity
to “take its head out of the sand,” and face the realities that are
everywhere presenting themselves. The appearance of three-dimensionally
perceivable UFOs of the mechanical type should lead first to questions
of whether or not the object behaves in accordance with known physical
laws or whether it exhibits properties not consistent with laws of
“solid matter.” Did it display erratic movement patterns or maneuvering
abilities seemingly superior to those of known vessels of transport in
the earth system? When such events are encountered it is usually assumed
(if the sightings’ reality is given any credibility at all) that the UFO
must be a physical vessel of transport, made of solid matter and
possessing a mechanical technology advanced in comparison to your own.
This is not always the case. Some three-dimensional mechanical-type UFOs
are indeed solid vessels. Some are quite terrestrial in nature and are
born of the secret scientific societies that exist within the Earth’s
governmental structures; we call these covert constructions the Interior
Government. In sightings involving this group the government will not
“own up to” its flying devices, as to do so would require revealing that
it is in possession of technologies that are superior to what it has led
the public and general scientific communities to believe. It is easier
to allow such sightings to fall “between the cracks” and join the ranks
of other UFO sightings or unexplained phenomena, rather than to incite
individuals to begin asking the right questions. Much is being withheld
globally by such government underground, including many developments
concerning your own technologies as well. Your sciences and physics are
far more advanced than you have been led to believe, and this cover up
of information has been a consciously orchestrated deception emanating
from the highest places within your governmental hierarchies. You have
technologies and knowledge presently within your culture that could
literally wipe out most of the maladies you experience on a global
scale, but this knowledge is being kept from you by segments of your own
populace. The knowledge in the possession of the underground elite would
literally disintegrate all the present cultural structures as you know
them, from science to health care, economics and religion. So do not
expect the governments to “own up to” even their own witnessed UFOs
unless they are hard pressed for an alternative program of
disinformation. They will use whatever tactics necessary to squelch the
expansion of the knowledge they hold. We will provide more information
on the Interior Government in later writings. However, some
three-dimensional mechanical UFOs are not simply covert developments of
the technologically elite, they are far more. Some such UFOs are indeed
“space ships” or vessels of transport belonging to other intelligent
species within your galactic sector. Yes, you are being visited, watched
and studied by various other cultures of intelligent beings that you are
not yet, as a whole, aware of. And yes, some of your UFO sightings
involve solid-matter vessels piloted by such life forms. Many of these
visitors are indeed from “outer space” as you think of it, and some of
these groups are in active workings with your Interior Government. But
not ALL of your three- dimensional UFOs fit into these aforementioned
categories. There is quite often much more to the UFO than “meets the
eye,” as you will soon discover.</p>
<p>Deciphering UFOs You must begin to realize the truths hidden within your
mathematics and geometries, for in the mechanics of these sciences the
existence of multiple worlds (parallel Earths) and dimensions is
indicated and will one day be proven as fact. There are Parallel Earth
Systems and there are portals through time that link your world with
others and with other versions of itself. Some of these other worlds
(Earths) have a more advanced technology than your own. Some know how to
use the Time Portal System and explore your reality just as you might
explore life upon another planet, if you had the ability and knowledge
to do so. Many of your sightings of mechanical-type and light-formation
type UFOs emanate from these other systems. At times objects (and
people) from these parallel systems interface briefly with your system,
and they can appear in a variety of different forms. What you might see
as a “cigar-shaped object” hovering in the sky in your reality may in
actuality be a house, a car or a weather pattern from a parallel
dimension interfacing with your time-space coordinate accidentally. Such
phenomena are not necessarily “vessels” or “travel craft” at all, but
common objects from a parallel system that appear in different form when
they interface with the electromagnetic frequency bands of your
dimension. In your photographs they may appear as discs or craft, but in
such cases that would be an illusion created by dimensional distortion.
Not all discs or UFOs fit into this category either but it will serve
your research well if you are aware of this possible explanation, for
many of your sightings are just this phenomenon in action. Other discs
and vessels are actual solid-matter transport devices but these will
emanate from within your own dimensional system, either from
human-related sources or from sources of an extra-terrestrial nature. To
further this point a bit we will add that many of your “naturally
occurring” biophysical phenomena (such as ball lightening) are also
sightings of the interdimensional kind. Sightings so common that your
scientists consider them part of the organic operations of planetary
physics. These common interdimensional phenomena (lightning, thunder,
magnetic variations, etc.) are actually the residual effect of action
taking place within other dimensional fields. As you may now see, when
addressing the issue of UFOs you are not dealing with events that have
only one explanation. All of the proposed explanations do apply but it
is up to you to discover which one you are dealing with in each case.
For your information, the US government does possess three-
dimensionally solid wreckage from various craft not of human
manufacture. This wreckage has come from two primary places, and some of
it is not wreckage at all. There have been vessels of transport from
parallel dimensional systems that passed through the time and
dimensional portal structures and emerged within your system. These
craft are not equipped to deal with magnetism as it exists within your
dimension, and they most often crash or incinerate upon entry. There are
four such wreckage fragments presently in the possession of the US
government. Two of these originate from systems parallel to your own and
two have come from third-dimensional systems outside of your Milky Way
galaxy.  The wreckage of these four aforementioned vessels is the least
of which your government is attempting to hide. There exist several
hundred other vessels of advanced technology harbored by the US
government alone (many more globally), but these were not the result of
reconnaissance. The vessels and instrumentation we speak of were
traded…presented as a gift from those whose culture created them…a
culture your government has been aware of since 1926 and actively
involved in negotiations with since 1934. Wake up humans! If you
continue to believe without question the information concerning UFOs and
extra-terrestrial life presented to you by your government and media,
you will effectively render yourselves blind and powerless over the true
reality within which your lives are couched—a reality that you need to
be aware of before you allow yourselves to fall victim to the
disinformation that has been hand fed to you for generations. If you
think that your human species is alone and superior within the universe
you are in for a rude awakening! Within the next 50 to 60 years of your
time the reality of which we speak will become painfully obvious to many
of you, even to those who choose to keep their heads in the sand and
pretend away the existence of extraterrestrial and multidimensional
reality. Your awakening does not have to be painful—not if you are
prepared, not if you are informed. And so we seek to make available to
you the information you will need in order to make a smooth transition
into multilevel inter-galactic consciousness—the next stage of growth
upon the pathway of human evolution.</p>
<p>Types of UFOs The three-dimensional mechanical-type UFOs we have
discussed thus far can be placed into the following four categories:
those belonging to covert government operations who will maintain a
policy of non-disclosure and denial regarding sightings of their crafts.
those representing interdimensional anomalies from parallel systems that
appear as vessels but in actuality represent other phenomena as they
appear when interfacing with your system. actual craft from other
dimensions that emerge through the Time and Dimensional Portal Systems. 
actual craft belonging to human or extra-terrestrial cultures that
emerge through the Time Portal System from locations within the third-
dimensional universe. In all of these cases the craft appear physically
solid, some having material wreckage left behind as validation of their
existence. There have been photographs, film, radar and eye-witness
accounts of all such phenomena, though rarely are your sightings
researchers able to make distinctions between these categories unless
obvious visitor presence is indicated. There are other categories of
UFOs related to these which need to be addressed. Quite often there are
reports of encounters with UFOs that do not have the characteristic
physical vessel structures as mentioned above. Often reports of
“paranormal” activity also fall into this category. Frequently sightings
of this sort are dismissed as naturally occurring atmospheric anomalies
or mental aberrations. We are referring here to the sightings and
encounters of phenomena that appear as light-form manifestations. There
is a wide variety of such displays ranging from simple “flashes” or
“sheets” of light (witnessed both indoors and outdoors) to large
appearances of spherical light forms, singularly or in group formation,
that appear as three-dimensional energy forms. Often when these are
photographed they appear as UFOs though usually a vessel or solid-mass
source of light emanation cannot be found. Some encounters involve the
appearance of such light-form activity which then manifests into a
solid-mass vessel sighting or an odd experiential journey on the part of
the witness. These light-form sightings are much easier to discount as
insignificant as they breach the boundaries between the “seen and
unseen”…the physical and ethereal…the “real and unreal.” There are
many more accounts of such encounters than you realize, but most often
they go unreported or easily discounted by scientific and governmental
communities. Witnesses themselves frequently discount their own
perceptions as quirks of vision or imagination. Though some light-form
activity can be explained in terrestrial terms as naturally occurring or
psychological phenomena, many of these encounters are not so easily
explained. We would like to “shed some light” on the subject for you.
Previously we described the type of UFO in the solid matter category
that was in actuality a manifestation created through the interface of
your system with a parallel or adjacent dimensional world. Some being
actual vessels, and others only appearing as such as they passed through
your system’s frequency bands. Not all of these interdimensional
phenomena appear as solid objects when they are within the
electromagnetic patterns of your world. More often than not light
(flashes, forms, pulsations, movements) will be the indication that an
interdimensional interface has occurred. Again, as with the solid object
sightings, not all of these represent an intentional “visitation” by
some intelligent force. Many are simply part of the mechanics of physics
as they operate within a multi- dimensional reality system such as your
own. (Physics your scientists are just beginning to discover and are far
from comprehending). However, just because some of the interdimensional
manifestations are not purposely directed by sentient life forms does
not mean that all of them are accidental and intrinsic to natural laws.
Some such interdimensional phenomena are indeed directed purposely by
intelligent beings from other systems, both of human and nonhuman
origins. Some of these manifestations involve the Interdimensional Time
Portal System directly and allow humans in other dimensional worlds or
time-space coordinates to interact with and study your system. In these
cases your UFOs are actually human “earthlings,” but they have their
home in a dimension closely adjacent to your own. Some would be from
your past, some from your future and some from alternate presents. But
not all such visitations would be from those in human form.</p>
<p>Extraterrestrial Visitation There are other highly intelligent non-human
species residing in your universe; for your comfort we suggest that you
get used to this idea as soon as possible. Of the light-formation
sightings we mentioned most do not fall into the two groupings we have
discussed. Most are not accidental dimensional interface phenomena or
natural atmospheric anomalies nor are they intentional interdimensional
probes sent by sentient life forms in other dimensions. Though some
light-formation sightings do fall into these categories most fall into a
third category—a category you might loosely call “alien visitation.”
In choosing this term we are implying that most of the light- formation
sightings witnessed in your times are the direct result of
extraterrestrial involvement with your planet. Within your own universal
structure, in your three-dimensional band, there exist an enormous
variety of sentient, intelligent life. Your scientists will not find
much evidence of these cultures until they break the primary codes of
your three-dimensional time structure. There are time zones within your
universe, as well as multiple dimensions of those time zones. Though the
mechanics of these two systems are intertwined they represent two
separate areas of study. The Time Portal System, as we call it, involves
a system of interlocking passageways that keep in motion a set of
“locks” or “gates” between time elements in your linear time structure
within your three- dimensional frequency band. The Dimensional Lock
System differs from the Time Portal System in that its mechanics operate
and maintain the dimensions and frequency bands themselves linking
multi- dimensional universes not just time zones within the same
universe/dimension.</p>
<p>The Visitors In terms of your “alien” visitors, or extraterrestrials, we
are referring specifically to those visitors who approach your reality
from within the Time Portal System. That is, they are not
interdimensional so much as they are inter-time, emanating from
different time coordinates within your three-dimensional interstellar
system. So most of your light- form UFOs are indeed extraterrestrial
intelligence interacting directly with you. There are seven cultures
(world cultures and their various sub- cultures) within your
three-dimensional Time Portal System who possess the knowledge and
technology necessary to interact with Earth in such a way. Two of these
cultures are primarily responsible for all such visitations (light
formation, solid mass and crop circle events). The remaining five are
not involved with your planet or galactic system. Of these two world
cultures one group is more advanced than the other in terms of
brotherhood.</p>
<p>Zeta Reticuli One group has presently been identified in your culture,
and within the inner circles of those who investigate such visitations,
this group has become known as the “little greys” or Zeta Reticuli. 
Others call them the “lizzies,” referring specifically to the Rutilia
sub-species of Zeta that have a more reptilian-like appearance when
manifesting within your system. Though technologically and
intellectually astute the Zeta generally do not possess the spiritual
development necessary to forge strong bonds of brotherhood with other
life forms. Like humans, the Zeta also are evolving. The Zeta are indeed
real, and physical in terms of biological form. They are not from your
planetary system, but they have a working knowledge of the Time Portal
System in your dimension. It is the Zeta and affiliated groups, such as
the reptilian Dracos, that have been in contact with your government and
are responsible for much of what you have come to call the “UFO/alien
abduction” phenomena.</p>
<p>Little Greys The Zeta represent more than just the Little Greys (those
small greyish beings with large black eyes).  There are various
sub-species of the Zeta prototype, some more “hybrid like” in
appearance, some resembling other forms not at all organic to your
system. There are lizard-like Zeta in numerous colorings and sizes.
There are Zeta that more closely resemble your insect kingdoms,
particularly that of the arachnid (spider-like) though somewhat larger
than your earthly versions. Other types of Zeta have been described by
your witnesses as “blues,” “browns,” and “silvers,” all of which possess
some human-like or dwarflike characteristics, and who represent a group
of Zeta mutations created through their experiments in genetic
engineering. The blue-skinned Zephelium are the administrator caste of
the Zeta, governing all lower-ranking Zeta castes. The Zeta are a
fragmented species and their customs and policies differ widely among
the various groups.</p>
<p>Aethian Often seen appearing with the Zeta (especially with the “greys,”
“browns” and “blues”) are the tall skeletal-like beings that upon closer
inspection resemble in structure your earthly preying mantis insect.
These beings are usually whitish or golden in color and can stand up to
twelve feet tall. These beings are known in some circles as the Aethien.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    Aethien are not of the Zeta species but often work with them and
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>assist humans in their encounters with the Zeta. They also work with
those from other dimensional systems. The Aethien are not organic to
your three-dimensional frequency band, nor are they from parallel or
adjacent Earths. Rather they originate from galaxies existing within the
dimensions of adjacent Earths, which places them in our
interdimensional/extraterrestrial category. Aethien work with humans and
other sentient life forms both in your dimension and in others, and
throughout the Time Portal Systems in those dimensions. They represent a
species superior to that of the Zeta, and come as emissaries of peace
and growth toward brotherhood for all species.  The Aethien always work
as teachers. When they appear with the Zeta or other three-dimensional
extraterrestrial groups the Aethien are with them but not of them. Only
Zeta groups who have agreed to work in brotherhood with all life will be
accompanied by the Aethien. At this point in your species evolution you
need to begin to understand how vast is your playing field of
three-dimensional reality and what other players are alive within this
drama. We are not trying to frighten you with this information, but
rather we are hoping to give you the framework of intelligence needed
for you to understand your reality and cope with it effectively. The
Zeta groups come to you for numerous reasons, some of them to benefit
humankind (the more spiritually advanced groups) and others to study you
for their own purposes (these are mostly responsible for your reports of
“negative” or harmful alien encounters). Both groups possess technology
and operational knowledge of reality systems far superior to that of the
human race at this time. They understand multidimensionality to a large
degree and are avid users of the Time Portal Systems of the third
dimension. Their sciences are built upon this knowledge, and thus there
is much humankind could learn from the Zeta. The Zeta possess physically
solid three-dimensional vessels, but only the smallest ones have ever
approached Earth’s atmosphere. However, as they know the mechanics of
the Time Portal System they are able to place their vessels just outside
of the frequency bands that constitute your three-dimensional system.
They are able to establish “holding patterns” between dimensions and
thus can become invisible to your system at will. The Zeta also have the
ability to use the Dimensional Lock System to some degree and are able
to appear in some of the adjacent dimensions. But the Zeta originate
from your three-dimensional system in a different time continuum than
your present reality. Though possessing knowledge far superior to your
own, the Zeta do not have a full understanding of the Dimensional Lock
System, nor have they mastered the Time Portal Systems of adjacent
dimensions. Both humans and the Zeta have much to learn. Ranthia The
second group of extraterrestrial cultures from your three- dimensional
system presently working with you are those whom we call the
Rhanthunkeana (ron than con’ a). Some refer to them as the Ranthia.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    They are from the distant stars in terms of your universe, but
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>they have full mastery over the Time Portal System. (They are
responsible, in part, for many of your “crop circles.”) The Ranthia are
more advanced technologically and spiritually than are the Zeta, and
they have been involved in your Earth culture since its beginnings. They
have been your guardians in many ways and have helped protect your
species and planet from interference both multidimensionally and
galactically. The Ranthia also possess the ability to “park” between
dimensional frequencies so as to appear invisible to your world. Like
the Zeta, the Ranthia often appear in your system as light formations,
especially those that manifest in spherical form. Unlike the Zeta,
however, the Ranthia are not fully “matter based,” biologically
speaking. They possess the ability to manifest in physical form within
numerous dimensions when desired, but they are not confined to a reality
with matter densities as strident as your own. They are “masters of
hologram” as are the Zeta, but the Ranthia have superior abilities in
this regard. The physicality of the Ranthia could be compared to what in
your system appears as water. That is, their “organic form” has the
properties of fluidity you associate with the element of water. They can
take on many forms because of this fluidity of form, yet they are a
conscious, sentient, intelligent race of beings. Many of the visitors
presently involved with Earth, both interdimensional and those of the
Time Portal System, have the ability to bend the laws of physicality as
you know them. Many of them are “shape-shifters” and can modulate the
dimensional frequencies and time portals sufficiently so as to manifest
to you in whatever form they desire. The Zeta and Aethien use this
ability quite often in dealing with humans, taking on animal forms,
human forms or those of solid objects. Zeta are the least skilled in
this area as they lack certain bioenergetic characteristics (the
“emotional body” energies) that are required to fully master the art of
transmutation. They can link forms and partially transmute, but to do so
causes excessive drain upon their own biological systems. Most often the
Zeta will remain physical and use simple frequency modulation tactics to
“scramble” the brain wave patterns of those viewing them3. They are
there, but they can interfere with the human’s bioelectrical system
sufficiently enough to make themselves appear invisible, “ghost-like” or
disguised in other forms. We will discuss this “perceptual interruption”
tactic in greater detail within the pages to come.</p>
<p>The Old Zeta Agenda There are a large number of Zeta involved with
research upon your planet, and some of them possess agendas you need to
become aware of so you do not fall into their plans as they desire. Your
Interior Government has been working with the Zeta on some of these
agendas but even they do not realize what is being orchestrated. The
Interior Government itself is being tricked and used manipulatively into
facilitating the Zeta plan. The “Zeta Agenda,” as we call it does not
simply involve your dimensional system alone. As we have explained, the
Zeta have limited access to interdimensional passageways. Your
three-dimensional Earth system is not the only system the Zeta are
interested in exploring. The Zeta are a driven race, driven by a vision
and a purpose which stem from their home planet. This planet’s name is
insignificant to you as its location cannot be charted within your
time-space continuum using the mechanics you presently have available.
On their home planet the Zeta evolved within their own time continuum to
a point of technological sophistication superior to your own. Their
cultures were not originally structured like human culture, as they
possessed a more centralized community model. They did not think
independently for centuries of their evolution, but operated as
individual units of a collective mind. The Zeta mind was exploring
methods by which they could break through the Dimensional Lock System,
hoping to expand their reality and knowledge by consuming (draining
energy from) parallel and adjacent versions of their own planet and
combining these reality fields with their own. They had mastered the
three-dimensional Time Portal System and wanted to “expand their
territory.” They did not realize, however, that using the methods they
employed would destabilize the time portals and dimensional bands of
their own system. They were partially successful in blending dimensions
in their world but they did not realize the consequence of these actions
until it was too late. The Zeta did not originally possess the small
grey forms you have come to know. This form resulted from a mutation in
their genetic code caused by the frequency blending to which they had
subjected themselves. This mutation intensified over numerous
generations, the form weakening, losing strength and agility, losing
power, until the time came when they could no longer tolerate the
atmospheric conditions of the planetary home for which they had been
intended. (The original Zeta prototype was a larger white-colored being
possessing bilateral symmetry and having certain characteristics
resembling those of the early human, but with a greater number of
appendages. The wide variety of Zeta forms now existing are the result
of uncountable genetic experiments. There are many similarities between
your Earth reptiles and the original Zeta form, particularly those of
the early reptiles that roamed the Earth.) As each successive generation
paired they progressively lost the ability to naturally procreate their
species. They became genetically neutered. The dimensional merger that
they had forced also caused irreparable damage to their planetary
structure. They had set in motion the death of their planet and its
dimensional counterparts. These events, from the perspective of your
time continuum, are occurring in what you would perceive as your future.
The Zeta then have “gone back in time” to your time continuum (and
others) in hope of finding answers and solutions to their dilemma. Part
of their own Time Portal System collapsed because of these events, so
they are unable to access their own portals directly. (They cannot thus
access the “past” of their planet before the destruction as they had
originally hoped). The Zeta entered your time continuum because of the
proximity of Earth’s time portals to their own and also because the
Earth has certain environmental elements the Zeta need for survival.
(Oxygen- based air systems, water systems and the presence of elements
such as zinc, plutonium and iron-based minerals.) However, the carbons
in your environment proved to be toxic to the Zeta, and those
interacting with your system found themselves in accelerated states of
deterioration.</p>
<p>Original Zeta Agenda and the World Wars We have given you information
about the Zeta so that you may begin to understand their motives for
involvement with you. Their original purpose involved accessing other
dimensional versions of their planet and time continuum by going through
your time portals, as they had destroyed their own. If they could move
through the dimensional portals of Earth and into a parallel system,
then access their own “past” planet and time continuum from there, they
hoped to reconstruct the pathways to their own three-dimensional time
continuum—to reattach their three-dimensional zone to the
interdimensional grid. They had not planned to interact with you for any
period of time Their plan was good in theory but not in application, as
the Zeta soon discovered. Though they possessed much knowledge of how
the time portals worked in a three-dimensional system, they did not have
such mastery over the time portals in other dimensional systems. Large
groups of Zeta became “trapped between dimensions,” and stuck in your
time/space continuum. They “leaped into” your system from the third
dimension, moving backward in time. They accessed certain other versions
of your continuum, but were unable to “leap” from there into their own
other dimensional time continuum. The Zeta were a dying race trapped in
time very far from home. The Zeta began to look for other alternatives.
They became involved with experimentation in your Earth dimension and in
some others. Meanwhile the health of the Zeta was suffering. The carbon-
based elements present to some degree in all of the Earth dimensions was
rapidly declining their species. On your planet the scope of the Zeta
involvement accelerated just after your First World War. The environment
was being speculated at this time. Attempts were made at raising the
Zeta’s biological tolerance level to the carbon elements but these
experiments were met with little success. By the time of your Second
World War the Zeta had devised a plan of genetic cross-breeding. They
became interested in creating a Zeta-human hybrid, a mutation, in the
hope that such a form would allow the continuation of their species
within the three- dimensional Earth and adjacent systems. At first other
life forms were studied (cattle, rodents, lizards, birds, etc.), other
Earth species, but these experiments were not successful and produced a
variety of sorry creatures that the Zeta later destroyed. Finally the
human species was approached as a last resort (there would obviously be
more difficulty with experimentation involving humans directly). For a
period of time corpses were used for these experiments as they attempted
to link the human DNA with that of the Zeta. These experiments also
failed. During your Second World War the Zeta came into communications
with humans directly. (They are in part responsible for the final
activation stages of the atomic bomb). You must recall, we explained
that the Zeta were capable of “shape-shifting” to some degree, and they
specialized in the art of “perceptual interference,” being able to alter
human perceptual frequency enough to appear in whatever forms they
chose. Using these tactics to establish contact and to infiltrate the
human governmental systems, agreements were formed between the Zeta and
the US, British and German governments. The Zeta were not particularly
concerned at the time with the outcome of World War Two, they “sold out
to the highest bidder” so to speak. The Zeta had great interest in the
Nazi experimentation with genetics and were supportive of their agenda
of creating a “superior race.” The Zeta would let the humans help them
create a genetically superior human prototype which they would then use
to create the Zeta- human hybrid. Zeta interest in the Hitler regime
began to dwindle over disagreements concerning the Nazi’s anti-Semitic
policy. Like the Nazis, the Zeta viewed the Jewish peoples as a race,
not simply a religious grouping, but unlike the Nazis, the Zeta believed
the Jewish race to be superior genetically, and they were not interested
in a human prototype that did not carry the coding particular to the
Jewish race. (More will be given on the Zeta perspective of the Jewish
people in other writings). The Zeta interest then began gravitating
toward the opposing factions. They were beginning to take interest in
the outcome of the war as they had a vested interest in keeping those of
Jewish lineage alive and well. The Zeta wanted this genetic strain
protected at all cost, so they began negotiations with the allied
governments. Around this time the aforementioned Aethien (mantis-like
beings from a universe within a parallel dimension) began interacting
with the Zeta in other dimensions, with the intention of teaching the
Zeta better ways to fulfill their purposes without violating the human
populace. The Zeta remaining in the three-dimensional Earth system were
of the last to accept guardianship from the Aethien. But the Aethien are
committed to assisting the Zeta in their spiritual growth toward
brotherhood, and so maintain an open invitation for assistance to Zeta
in all dimensions. During the time of World War II the Zeta in your
system approached certain elements of government in the allied forces,
using the guise of human form. Remember, they were adept at “perceptual
interference” and so were able to place themselves in key positions to
be heard when new ideas were most needed by the allies. The Zeta
themselves set in motion the structures for what has become your global,
covert Interior Government. Using their human guise they were able to
offer certain strategic and technological advancements to top military
groups. They also began preparing the humans for direct contact with the
Zeta in their true forms. Great meetings were orchestrated in which the
human covert elite were introduced to the Zeta and certain aspects of
their technology. The Zeta came under the guise of wanting to help
humanity and of being concerned with world peace. They used their
advanced technology and knowledge of universal physics to seduce their
human cohorts into believing they were far superior to humans and came
as “angels” or planetary guardians. The Zeta play upon the core
religious beliefs of the people and their fears to create the illusion
of themselves as “saviors” so as to foster human dependence—a covert
method of gaining human cooperation with their agenda. Much effort was
put into building human perception of Zeta as saviors and helpers. Only
later, after the “debt” involving the outcome of World War II was
“incurred,” so to speak, did the Zeta begin to demonstrate their desire
to have favors exchanged for their services during war time. Military,
medical and communications knowledge was given to the Allies during this
time. The humans, easily enthralled by the sophistication of the Zeta
technology, had no idea just how much knowledge the Zeta withheld from
them. Nor how the knowledge that was given was used to direct and
manipulate the humans for Zeta purposes. The individuals presently
involved in the Interior Government still have no idea of the degree to
which they have been and are being manipulated. To those of you involved
in these covert activities (you know who you are) we suggest that you
wake up now! Take charge of your destiny and break free before that
choice is no longer available to you. The Zeta are not “evil monsters”
out to get humanity, they are simply a species trying to solve their
problems. But so much like humans the Zeta often do not realize the harm
and violation they bring to other life forms in their quest for growth.
Both humans and Zeta need to evolve spiritually into a working knowledge
of universal brotherhood.</p>
<p>Old Zeta Agenda and Personal Growth Currently your visible world
government leaders know very little about the workings of the Interior
Government. Most know of its existence but they have been misinformed
and misdirected so they will not receive adequate information about the
true operations of this community. The individuals who do have direct
knowledge of the covert group have agreed to perpetuate the debunking
activities set in motion by the covert group at the Zeta’s insistence in
hope that they will be “let in on the secrets.” The Interior Government
has proposed to certain individuals within the official government that
great advances in power, economic strategies, and healing modalities
will be given at an appropriate time if these officials will cooperate
with them now. These individuals in the official government are led to
believe that the Interior Government and the Zeta are working with them
and for them. When in truth the plan has been since its beginnings to
undermine and take control of the official positions when the
appropriate mass control devices have been set in motion. All of this
might sound a bit far fetched to you but this is only because you have
been brainwashed for so long. Your official governments are not
responsible for the activities of the Interior Government nor are they
working in cooperation with them as they think they are. The official
governments are fast becoming “puppets” to these interior forces and
will eventually find themselves at their mercy if they do not wise up
and change their public disclosure policies. Your governments presently
are ignorant to the reality going on around and within them, and will
remain so as long as they allow themselves to be blinded by arrogance,
elitism and the quest for power. To the “common” people, please see
these frailties of those to whom you give your power. They are like
children playing with dangerous toys. Individuals, have the courage to
begin asking the right questions! The idea of an Interior World
Government may come as a surprise to many of you because you have been
conditioned for centuries into the blind adherence to the dictates of an
outside authority. Though at one time this conditioning may have been in
the best interest of human development, as your species learned to work
within a group collective, this tactic of learning is no longer
appropriate to the well being of the species or to the individuals
within the human collective. For it is precisely this conditioning that
is being used to manipulate and misguide you. Along with awareness comes
the responsibility of using that awareness effectively. We have given to
you now the gift of awareness concerning the activities taking place
within the infrastructure of your power-elite. For many of you the
burden this gift will carry may seem too much to bear. After all we are
suggesting that you begin to think for yourselves, to question the very
authorities to whom you have always turned for guidance and security. We
are compelling you to begin looking within yourselves to the core of
your private being, to begin looking for answers from the whisperings of
your heart rather than accepting programmed responses from the confines
of your logical mind. A heavy burden of responsibility indeed for those
who have become complacent within the pre-programmed illusion of
“official” reality that has been hand fed to you through government,
media and religious dogma. We cannot urge you enough to begin looking
within, to discover the wisdom and brilliance of your inner self—a
portion of your own identities that you have been programmed to
discount, negate, and fear. For it is through this disowned self that
lives within each of you that your own truth will be discovered. It will
be from this place within you that you will be enabled to find your own
answers. And those answers may very well put you at odds with the
official reality program you have been fed. Taking the time to look at
the beliefs and ideas that constitute your moral, ethical and perceptual
codes will be well worth the investment, as then you will gain mastery
over the contents of your conscious mind, rather than allowing that mind
to be directed by the whims of those outside of you—those who may or
may not have your best interest at heart. As you temporarily sacrifice
the sense of false security and pat answers given to you by the
“official program” you may take comfort in knowing that you are gaining
the priceless acquisition of self-sovereignty. Through self-sovereignty
true personal security and clear answers will be found. In relation to
subjects such as Interior Government, ET life, “paranormal” phenomena or
self empowerment you will not find a great deal of support for your
interest from the “official” viewpoint. Indeed, the official program
presently in place within your mass reality depends upon the negation of
these very aspects of human reality. The brainwashing program has been
so well orchestrated through your subconscious beliefs that even your
friends and family may stand against you when you begin to ask the right
questions. They have been taught not to question. They have been
programmed to follow the program and to perceive as a threat anything
that questions the motives or applications of that program.</p>
<p>The Program You may be wondering now what we are referring to when we
speak of the “brainwashing program,” so we will provide a bit more
information concerning the “official reality program” presently
operating in your world system. You do not feel “brainwashed,” you may
be having a difficult time grasping the idea that you have been
brainwashed, and you most likely do not think that there is anything
amiss within the ideas and beliefs propagated by your official outside
authorities (government, the medical experts, the economic experts, the
defense experts, the scientific community, the religious experts, etc.)
The very structure of your daily lives seems to depend upon those
“experts” figuring it all out for you, telling you “how it is” and what
is the “right thing to do.” Through these seeming authorities you are
taught not to think about the bigger picture, about what reality really
means, about the purposes your existence may hold. You are taught to
believe that such questions are unimportant or perhaps unanswerable. You
are taught to “follow the rules” as dictated by the majority, to think
as your parents had thought, and they as their parents thought before
them. This is the program of which we speak and presently for most of
you, it operates on a subconscious level. Where did this program of
dis-empowering the individual originate? Did it emerge accidentally as a
quirk of human belief evolution? How did it come to be that this program
of ideas now defines reality for you and urges you to never define
reality for yourselves? Who has trained you to believe that humans are
the only intelligent life forms in the universe? Where did your species
get the idea that the only real reality was that which could be defined
through the five known senses? You have been trained to believe that
“this is just the way reality is,” and most of you still accept that
premise. This is the program! Where do you think these ideas have come
from? (You may not ever have considered this query, as to ask that
question is not part of the program). This program of ideas did not come
to you accidentally, nor as a quirk of evolution. And this official
program that now serves as a reality filter for you does not give you a
clear or accurate picture of how reality “really” is. Who do you think
benefits from your believing that ET life is not reality? Who do you
think might benefit from humans being locked into a world of five sense
perception? Who do you think would most benefit from teaching
generations of humans not to question authority or the ideas upheld by
that authority? Until you begin to open your eyes and realize that ET
and other- dimensional intelligence play a significant role in human
evolution, and have been involved since the beginnings of your species
time on planet Earth, it will be difficult for you to define the “who”
or the intelligence behind and within the program. The Zeta are not the
only species of intelligent beings aware of and interacting with Earth.
Extraterrestrial involvement has been a reality since far before your
recorded history. Some groups of these visitors worked in behalf of
human evolution, others worked for the exploitation of the race. And
now, in your present point of evolution these factions still exist. Some
working toward your enlightenment, others working to enslave your
energies for their own purposes In this section we have given you
information on some of the covert activities currently taking place
within your reality. Though the official reality program you are living
within will not assist you in becoming aware of these events, as it is
primarily orchestrated by those factions interested in exploiting your
resources (they depend upon your ignorance and disbelief to protect
their covert agendas), there are other sources of information from which
you can draw perspective. But if you cannot pull yourselves out of the
program enough to realize the existence of these helpers, there is
little we can do to assist you in becoming informed.  You are
responsible for your own awareness and for the choices you make that
will either expand that awareness toward enlightenment or plunge you
into darkness and fear. We highly suggest that you pull yourselves out
of the program and begin, as individuals, to ask the right questions
concerning your planet, your government, your “experts,” and the beliefs
you have accepted regarding the true nature of reality. The information
we provide regarding the Zeta and the formation of the Interior
Government is intended to inspire you to ask who is pulling your strings
as individuals. The greater amount of information you have at your
disposal the better able you will be to make informed decisions and wise
choices. We are not suggesting an overt rebellion against authority as
you know it, but simply the use of a discerning eye when being presented
with views by those authorities. In looking within yourselves and
beginning to explore the portions of your identity and knowing that live
within, you will discover alternative perspectives to choose from. You
will have more information from which to draw your conclusions, and you
will find many more questions to ask that the program itself cannot
provide answers for. By asking the right questions you will begin a
personal spiritual odyssey that will lead you above and beyond the
program into the rightful enlightenment that is your next stage of
evolution as a human.</p>
<p>The Ranthia Now that we have given you a basic rundown on the Zeta
presence and agenda, and the “official reality program” as it presently
operates within your system, let us return to the discussion of UFOs
that appear in the form of light manifestations. The Zeta are not the
only three-dimensional ET forms capable of manifesting in this manner.
Though Zeta are skilled light manipulators, the aforementioned group the
Ranthia (Rhanthunkeana) have superior ability in using these mechanics.
Whereas Zeta usually create manifestations of form in conjunction with
light phenomena the Ranthia regularly make their presence known through
light phenomena alone. That is, the Ranthia most often do not create
illusions of three-dimensionally solid forms. The Ranthia also greatly
interact with humans during the human dream state and altered states of
consciousness. They are aware of the Zeta agenda, and like the other
dimensional Aethien, are attempting to teach humans, Zeta and others,
ideologies and technologies that will help these collectives work toward
the peaceful evolution of all concerned. The Ranthia originate from a
three-dimensional time coordinate in which the matter density is far
less than that of your Earth system. They are highly evolved both
technologically and spiritually from a three-dimensional standpoint.
They are able to see the far-reaching implications of what is now
transpiring within your system. The Ranthia now come to offer their
knowledge and assistance, and to intervene in the Zeta plan if possible.
The Ranthia are also masters of illusion, and they understand the
workings of the human bio-electric circuitry and the electromagnetic
mechanics of the planet. They will provide information and assistance to
those who desire to learn. Unlike the Zeta, the Ranthia must be asked to
intervene; they cannot impose their assistance or contact upon humans or
others without invitation. This is part of their own ethical code, which
honors the free will of all life, and they will not violate this
premise. Not all beings have reached this level of spiritual maturity.
Some Zeta groups who have agreed to accept the teachings and guidance
from the Aethien are now being led into agreements with the Ranthia. The
Ranthia and Aethien are attempting to shift the Zeta paradigm and agenda
to a model more conducive of peaceful evolution by offering
enlightenment and alternative solutions. Humans are being put in the
precarious position of having to take charge of their own destiny and
learn what is needed to play their part in working toward enlightened
brotherhood. Presently the masses are ill-prepared to fulfill this
leadership role effectively. The Ranthia and Aethien desire to work with
humans, to educate them and teach them what is necessary for fulfilling
their part in this multidimensional/intergalactic/inter-time scheme. But
it is often quite difficult for these helpers to interact with humans as
the present belief structures perpetuated by the “official program”
render their attempts at communication void, or suspicious at best. In
your culture little is understood about the nature of interdimensional
and inter-time communications. The methods by which these events take
place are largely misunderstood, and so it is this issue we will next
address. What is the method by which such communications come to you and
from whom do these communications emerge?</p>
