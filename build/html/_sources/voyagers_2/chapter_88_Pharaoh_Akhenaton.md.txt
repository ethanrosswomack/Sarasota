(1366 BC), and began the Atonist movement within the Egyptian New
Kingdom dynastic line. At the birth of Akhenaton in 1398 BC, the Arc of
the Covenant was opened and the Sphere of Amenti descended into Earth
core from the UHF bands of D-3. Twelve years later, in 1386 BC the Blue
Flame of Amenti descended and was embodied by the Melchizedek Cloister
Flame Holder, who became the High Priest of Akhenaton’s Atonist move~
ment. (Amenophis III died in 1385 BC when Akhenaton was 13 years old,
and Akhenaton served as regent with his mother Queen Tiy until 1370 BC,
when at age 28 he began his 17-year Pharaonic rule). The Melchizedek
Cloister soul group who were to serve as Keepers of the Flame were birthed
into this time period in synchronization with Akhenaton’s birth, so they
would be in the appropriate places to ful fill their role within the opening of
the Halls of Amenti. The Halls of Amenti opened 12 years later in 1374 BC,
after the frequencies of the embodied ﬂame had stabilized within the Earth
grid. 
     At the age of 24 Akhenaton was taken to the Inner Earth by the Priests
of Ur, and trained in the processes of ascension, which he would conduct
after his training was complete. In 1367 BC, at the age of 31, Akhenaton was
instructed to relocate his seat of power from Thebes to a location in middle
Egypt called Tel el-Amarna, where he constructed the city of Akhetaton in
honor of the Aton god and the Law of One. He was led to this location by
the Priests of Ur, as there, beneath the ground, were portals connecting to
the Inner Earth, through which he could pass into the portals beneath the
Great Pyramid of Giza, where the Arc of the Covenant and the Halls of
Amenti were found. The Giza pyramid was still under the control and protec-
tion of the Amonist priests of Serres-Egyptian lineage, among whom much
anti-Atonist sentiment stirred. The Priests of Ur did not want knowledge of
the opening of the Halls of Amenti known among the general Amonist
priest-cast, as certain abuses of power and distortion of the original Templar
creed had become prevalent in this group, and only Cloister Melchizedeks
born into the Serres-Egyptian elite were permitted knowledge of the opening
of Amenti.  
    The new city at T el el-Amarna allowed Akhenaton and his followers to
go about the business of ascension without drawing the attention of the
Serres priesthood, and also permitted easy access through the Inner Earth to
Giza, Thebes, Jerusalem and the city of Ur along the Euphrates River. Using
surface travel, these locations were hundreds of miles apart, but through the
portals of Inner Earth these locations could be accessed within minutes.
Akhenaton’s purpose in coming to Earth was to ensure the opening the Halls
of Amenti, to realign the morphogenetic field of the Annu races so they
could be re-entered into the Sphere of Amenti, and to orchestrate ascension
for the Templar-Annu, Annu-Melchizedeks and selected others of various
races, whose genetic codes were evolved enough to undergo this process. The
