                       The Third Seeding
the first 4,426 years of the cycle, and the last two waves during the final 4,426
years of the cycle. These two 4,426-year periods, which occur at the opening
and closing of a 26,566 year cycle, are referred to as Ascension Cycles.  Since
the Halls of Amenti were not opened during the first Ascension Cycle of the
new time cycle, the souls trapped in the D-2 elemental and D-4 astral king-
doms, as well as the humans on Earth, would have to wait until the final
Ascension Cycle of their 26,556-year time cycle, in order to ascend.  
     From 22,326 BC forward the Guardian races of HU-2, the Ra Confederacy
and the earthly guardians of the Arc of the Covenant planned, prepared and
waited for the next Ascension Cycle. This time the Halls of Amenti must be
opened —this time the Earth grid must be able to hold the Sphere of Amenti —
this time the many souls trapped within HU-1 must be allowed to ascend. The
final Ascension Cycle within this 26,556-year time cycle would begin in the
year 196 BC. The first morphogenetic wave of this Ascension Cycle was due to
be released in the year 2017 AD. The last morphogenetic wave of this Ascen-
sion Cycle would take place in 4230 AD.  If the Halls of Amenti wer e not opened
during this ﬁnal Ascension cycle, the souls of the masses would be unable to ascend to
Tara for another 26,556 years. If the Halls of Amenti could be opened by 2012
AD, or by 4230 AD at the latest, the races of Earth could finally reclaim the
divinity and dignity of their heritage and return to HU-2, to the reality of the
Immortal body and the original 12-strand DNA construction. Their conscious-
ness would no longer be trapped within HU-1 or in the D-4 astral planes. The
living and the dead (those souls trapped in the astral planes) would rise up and
ascend out of their earthly prisons and into the “heavenly” lands of Tara in
HU-2. These stories of ascension, which appeared within your traditional reli-
gious texts were originally given to you by the Elohim and others, in order to
explain the highly scientific process of dimensional ascension that your races
would be faced with when the Halls of Amenti were opened.

    Originally the teachings of ascension were quite scientific in nature, deal-
ing with the reality of multidimensional physics. The original information
brought to the races of the Third Seeding represented the teachings of the  Sci-
ence of Keylonta,  the underlying energetic mechanisms through which reality
is created and the processes through which consciousness evolves. The early
Atlantean cultures had full access  to this information, and until the T emplar-
Annu distorted the teachings in order to control the populations, the science
of ascension and multidimensional mechanics was publicly taught as a primary
belief model around which societies were structured. The teachings were given

                                                                                                       2017 AD Appointment
to all of the races throughout the globe, not just those of Egypt and Atlantis.
Over time, and through the oppression of the Templar-Annu and later control-
oriented political groups, the true teachings were distorted or destroyed as they
gave the common person power over their personal destiny. People who are
empowered cannot be controlled or manipulated by outside authorities, and so
the tool of empowerment, knowledge,  was taken away from the masses so the
few elite could hold them under their power.              
         What remains today of the ascension teachings is hardly an introduction to
the true science as it was once applied on Earth. Portions of the teachings survived
through the mystical schools of  the ages, kept under strict secrecy, as the politically
controlling factions of various time periods persecuted those who attempted to
bring the truth to the populations. Even today this persecution exists (though usu-
ally in more covert form), much of it within the traditional religious organizations
whose teachings have been highly distorted in order to keep people powerless and
subservient to religious authority figures.  The science of  ascension was withheld from
the masses, but the promise of ascension was used to manipulate people into supporting
and obeying the authorities who claimed that ascension could be accomplished only
through blind belief and adherence to their politically motivated creeds . The original
teachings were intended for everyone, not just to serve the objectives of a power
elite. Though certain groups were appointed with guardianship of the Sphere of
Amenti and the Arc of the Covenant, they were not intended to horde this
power and knowledge for themselves, but this is precisely what occurred through-
out various periods of Earth's history. The guardian races of 22,326 BC knew it
would be a challenge to prepare the masses for the Ascension Cycle of 196 BC-
4230 AD, but they had not originally planned for the disruptions caused by the
Templar-Annu and their Anunnaki Resistance allies.  
    Through the manipulation of the Anunnaki Resistance and the T emplar-
Annu, following the Atlantean explosions of 28,000 BC, preparing the races
for the morphogenetic wave of 2017 AD became a very difficult task, as the
teachings that would allow this preparation to go smoothly were lost, manip-
ulated, distorted or destroyed, and as time went on, the majority of humans
did not have access to this information. Throughout the development of
human culture since 28,000 BC the covert in ﬂuence of the Anunnaki Resis-
tance and that of the Templar-Annu proceeded to contaminate human con-
sciousness with the elitist, controlling creed initially developed by the
Templar Solar Initiates of Tara. The original Templar of Tara was a sacred
organization devoted to upholding the Law of One. The Taran Turaneusiam
races were gifted, by the Sirian Council, with the power and knowledge of
the Templar in order to serve as guardians of the Taran planetary grid. They
had the awesome responsibility of ensuring that Tara's energetic systems
remained balanced, and that Tara, and the Turaneusiam races, stayed upon
their course of evolution into the HU-3 planetary grid of Gaia. Due to the
