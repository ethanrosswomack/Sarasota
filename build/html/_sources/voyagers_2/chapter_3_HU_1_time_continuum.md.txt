3 HU-1 time continuum.  
    What this process constitutes in terms of the human perspective, is the
opening up of three tracks of time,  or three time continua, during the 10-year
period surrounding the half-point within the second ascension cycle. Human
beings and their consciousness are made up of energy particles. As Earth under-
goes this particle separation, transmutation and dimensional transfer, the ener-
getic structures of human biology and consciousness also undergo this
transformation via the makeup of their particle content. Humans possessing
the slowest vibration rates would find their consciousness fragmenting into the
distant past and their body form returning to the uni fied field of the first dimen-
sion. Not to worry, however, as the collective race consciousness now vibrates
high enough, thanks to the efforts of visiting guardian races, so humans would
not experience this evolutionary digression into D-1 in the event of a morpho-
genetic wave.  
      Humans possessing mid-range vibration rates, which is presently the
majority of the population, would normally find themselves within the present
time continuum, where things look the same, but this continuum, in actuality,

                                                                            DNA and the Halls of Amenti
would be taking place within the D-3 time cycle of the parallel universe. The
D-3 time cycle of parallel anti-particle Earth is, in reality, the same time cycle
as the fourth dimension cycle in the particle universe. Thus humans possessing
mid-range vibrational rates would find themselves on Earth entering the time
cycle of the fourth dimension for a period of five years. Humans who have the
highest vibration rates will enter hyper-space then re-appear on Earth within
the next Harmonic Universe up, HU-2, which constitutes a position in time
5532.5 years in the future. Humans with the highest vibration rates will find
themselves traveling through time, experientially either by portal passage or via
spacecraft, to the future parallel Earth of HU-2. The future Earth and its paral-
lel in HU-2 represent the planet Tara and its double, at a point in time 225 mil-
lion years in the future from the time of Tara’s cataclysm.¹  
    Normally , within five years following the half-point morphogenetic
wave crest, the overtone particles of Earth will have entered the HU-2 time
cycles. During the morphogenetic wave 2213 years in the future, at the natu-
ral close of the ascension cycle, the remaining base-tone particles of Earth
would transmute in the same manner. Earth would shift completely out of
HU-1 and fully enter the D-4 time cycle, the first 4,426-year cycle of the
26,556-year cycle in HU-2. This natural close of an ascension cycle is called
the Doreadeshi.  Earth’ s natural shift from the HU-1 to the HU-2 time cycles
would normally occur in two stages. The overtone particles of Earth shift in
the morphogenetic wave at the half-cycle point, and the base-tone particles
of Earth shift 2213 years later, in the second morphogenetic wave at the close
of the cycle. At that point the full particle base of Earth would be stationed
in HU-2, having evolved through dimensional ascension, out of HU-1. The
particles composed of overtone frequencies undergo this transformation half-
way through the ascension cycle, and the particles composed of base-tone fre-
quencies follow suit, 2213 years later, at the end of the ascension cycle.

                             the Blue Flame and Human Evolution  
    The complex processes of particle mechanics, morphogenetic waves
and time cycles that we have just outlined, represent the natural hidden
dynamics of planetary dimensional ascension and the evolution of conscious-
ness through time. An essential part of this process is the relationship
between these multidimensional energy mechanics and the operation of the
Sphere of Amenti. For the Halls of Amenti to open to the races during the_________________________  
1.   Cataclysm occurred 550 million years ago from the perspective of  HU-1 Earth time. HU-
2 time cycles are the same amount of time in terms of evolutionary distance covered, but
they move twice as fast. D-4 time cycles cover the same block of time in half the number
of years it would take to complete that block of time in the D-3 cycle. Thus 550 million
years on Earth in the D-3 time cycle represents 225 million years on Tara in the D-4 time
       cycle.

Ascension Mechanics  
10-year time warp/dimensional blend period surrounding the half-cycle
point, the Earth grid vibration must raise high enough to spark/open the Arc
of the Covenant. The Sphere of Amenti must descend through the Arc into
Earth’s D-2 core, and the Sphere must have its 12-year period of disbursing its
frequencies through the Earth grid, before the grids of Earth and Tara begin
to intersect five years prior to the half-point. The Blue Flame Staff of
Amenti, Earth’s portion of Tara’s D-5 morphogenetic field, allows Earth’s grid
to merge with Tara’s in D-4. If the Blue Flame is not embodied on Earth when the
grids begin to intersect, the infusion of D-5 energy from Tara’ s grid and the Holo-
graphic Beam cannot run through Earth’ s grid during the crest of the morphogenetic
wave.  In such a case the Earth’ s grid cannot link with T ara’ s to receive the
energy infusion, so Tara’s grid will link with whatever planetary core the Blue
Flame is stored within. The fifth-dimensional energy infusion would then
pass down from that planet, through the energy spiral of the Holographic
Beam and remain within the overtone particles of Earth, unable to pass into
Earth’s base-tone particles and grid. In this case Earth and the races would be
trapped for another 26,556 years within HU-1, the mass assembly of the fifth
DNA strand would not occur, and the majority of Earth’s people would have
to reincarnate into HU-1 until the next morphogenetic wave. This is only
the beginning of the problems that would occur if the Blue Flame were not
embodied on Earth during the time of grid intersection.  
    If the Earth grid could not link with T ara’ s, the Earth grid speed would
slow in vibration due to the excessive particle content that it could not
release through the first morphogenetic wave. After 2,213 years had passed
and the final morphogenetic wave of the cycle was due, the Earth grid vibra-
tion would be too low to hold the Sphere of Amenti and the Blue Flame, so
the grids of Earth and Tara again would be unable to merge. At the close of
the ascension cycle Earth’s excessive particle content and density would
make its grid speed and particle pulsation rate slow to the speed of the D-l
frequency bands. Earth would plunge from the sixth, and final, D-3 time con-
tinuum cycle in HU-1, back into the First D-1 time continuum cycle, of HU-
1. From this D-1 position, Earth would have to evolve through another
26,556-year Harmonic Time cycle in HU-1, before having another opportu-
nity to ascend to HU-2.  
    As you can perhaps now see, it is very important that the Sphere of
Amenti is appropriately placed in Earth’s core, and the Blue Flame success-
fully embodies, during the half-point in the second ascension cycle. If this
process does not occur, the Earth becomes trapped in HU-1 time. This digres-
sion and repetition of HU-1 time cycles has occurred seven times in the past
of Earth’s evolution. Earth is presently within its eighth repetition of the
26,556-year Harmonic Time cycle in HU-1. Earth’ s evolution has been stunted
within the  HU-1 time cycle for  nearly 212,448 years.  Though some progress was
made in dimensional ascension at several different points in time, Earth and

                                                                                DNA and the Halls of Amenti
the human races repeatedly ended up returning to the start of the 26,556-year
HU-l cycle.  
    Since 840,000 years ago, when the guardian races from HU-2 and above
created the Arc of the Covenant, they have watched, waited, nurtured,
guided, assisted and prayed (yes, prayed!) for the time to come when the lost
souls of Tara could return home from their long and troubled evolutionary
journey on Earth. They did this because your race was loved.  They have waited
patiently for the distant time when Earth, and the 11 other missing fragments
of Tara, could be returned into Tara’s energetic body, so Tara herself could
ascend. Great wars have been fought and great catastrophes endured to
secure your species’ right to evolve, and to uphold and protect the Covenant
of Palaidor, through which the integrity of your species’ evolutionary blue-
print is ensured.  
    Can you understand how important the next morphogenetic wave will
be in relation to the evolution of Earth and the souls who continue to repeat-
edly incarnate there? The next morphogenetic wave in your present 26,556-
year cycle is your potential ticket to freedom, after being imprisoned within
the illusion of HU-1 matter for over 200,000 years. If you are unable to utilize
that potential, you will sentence yourselves to yet another 26,556 years in the
prison of your Earth school, if your planet could survive long enough to com-
plete its next cycle.  
We    are    taking    great    pains    to    explain    the   dynamics  of    morphogenetic  waves 
to you because you are presently within the second ascension cycle of your
                                 26,566-year Harmonic Time Cycle.  
                 The ascension cycle began 2194 years ago in 196 BC.  
                 The half-point in your current time cycle is 2017 AD.  
                                           You have 19 years before  
             the first morphogenetic wave of this cycle completes its crest.  
                                   Do you think you will be ready?  
                             If the Guardian races had not intervened,  
                         your planet would not have made it this far.
