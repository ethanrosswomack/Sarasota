       #
       # Only include a single source file for the second volume.
       #
       # The original project attempted to glob every file under
       # ``voyagers_2/``, which resulted in hundreds of tiny pages with
       # no headings (often just page numbers or TOC snippets).  Furo
       # collapses huge toctrees into a dropdown and, when given more
       # than ~100 items without proper titles, the entire section
       # disappears from the navigation.  To restore a working table of
       # contents for Volume II we point the toctree at a single
       # long‑form document instead.
