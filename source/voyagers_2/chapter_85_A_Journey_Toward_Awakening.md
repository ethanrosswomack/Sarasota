A Journey Toward Awakening  
the Inner Earth Priesthood of Ur, whose training kept knowledge of the Arc
of the Covenant alive within the surface cultures. From 8,000 BC forward the
cultures developed with greater racial divisions, some groups leaving the
areas which came to be known as Giza, integrating into other cultural bases
along the Nile river, such as Thebes and into Nubia, others journeying into
the territories of what came to be known as Jerusalem, and Sumeria and Ur
along the Euphrates River, intermixing with the descendants of the other
Root Races and their Cloisters. The Serres-Egyptians and Cloister
Melchizedeks remained concentrated in the area of Giza where the Arc of
the Covenant entered the Earth, and continued to build up their civiliza-
tions, with periods of achievement tempered by periods of digression.  
    During the height of pre-dynastic Egypt, following an inﬂux of cultures
from various other regions, the Serres-Egyptians and Cloister Melchizedeks,
under the direction of the Priesthood of Ur, made an attempt to reconstruct
the remains of the Great Pyramid of Giza and the Sphinx, which had been
damaged in the deluge following the sinking of Atlantis in 9,958 BC. Using
manual labor, the Great Pyramid was restored around 5,546 BC, as a religious
center through which the Arc of the Covenant was fortified and secured, but
the structure no longer served as an interstellar teleport due to the pole tilt
resulting from the Atlantean cataclysm and the Frequency Fence of 9,540
BC. The Sphinx was reconstructed around 5,466 BC, the contours of the
structure's facial features were altered to more closely resemble the appear-
ance of the Serres-Egyptian line, and the stronger, more exaggerated facial
features characteristic to the Anunnaki lineage (who originally designed the
structure in 46,459 BC) were omitted from the reconstruction. The form of
the Leonine body remained as a tribute to remembered gods of Egyptian
mythology, who represented symbolic trace memories of ancient Anunnaki
affiliations with the HU-2 Leonine races. The early dynastic periods of Egypt
emerged around 3,500 BC, bearing increasing influence of cultural inﬂux
from various other regions. The Arc of the Covenant, Sphere of Amenti and
the tools of the Rod and the Staff became closely guarded secrets, held within the
conﬁnes of select Serres-Egyptian and Melchizedek Cloister families  with  whom the
Priests of Ur continued covert contact.
