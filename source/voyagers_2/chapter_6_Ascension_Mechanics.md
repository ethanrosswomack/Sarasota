                 The Science of Ascension, Time Cycles, Morphogenetic Waves                                                                                     and the Sphere of Amenti 
      As we have mentioned before, ascension is not some lofty spiritual con-
cept designed by the minds of man, it is the literal, tangible scienti fic process
of the evolution of consciousness and biology within the laws of energy
mechanics that apply to a multidimensional reality system. You can go about
your human lives, with your consciousness con fined to the limitations pres-
ently imposed by your physical body, or you can learn the mechanics by
which those limitations can be released, and begin to experience the reality
of freedom that is the comprehension of yourself-as-soul.  Whether or not you
view ascension and multidimensional evolution as a reality while you are alive on
Earth, you will be directly faced with that reality once your consciousness has
passed out of physical life and into the multidimensional framework. At the death
of the physical body you will discover that your consciousness lives on and
your evolution continues. How well you prepare for that discovery now will
determine the ease with which you are able to take your next evolutionary
step once you “wake up on the other side.” All souls will eventually evolve
and ascend through the 15-dimensional scale, to re-emerge as sentient iden-
tity within realms of pure consciousness beyond the dimensional systems. But
this process is not something that takes places automatically for humankind.
Humanity was created as a creator species, which means that thoughts and
actions entertained by the human will be met in manifest experience, both
on Earth and in the life experiences that take place beyond the earthly
planes. The choices one makes in thought and deed will determine the qual-
ity of experience, or lack thereof, that will be personally encountered in feel-
ing and event.  
    In preceding chapters  we have detailed for you the great challenges and
  struggles your species endured as it has blindly followed the hidden evolu-

                                                                                    Humanity’ s Evolution
tionary blueprint that calls it forth to evolve through time. That blueprint is
the Covenant of Palaidor and the morphogenetic field of the Sphere of
Amenti, within which the organizational plan and purpose for human evolu-
tion is stored. For 550,000,000 years this blueprint has called your races for-
ward toward an unseen destiny, which is the return of immortality and the
reunion of the consciousness of man with its creative Source.  In terms of the
soul’s perspective, the challenges and hardships faced along the way are
understood to be lessons in growth, as human consciousness evolves to
remember the truth of its eternal existence and embrace the beauty of its
multidimensional identity. From the perspective of a human consciousness
focused within a physical body on Earth, those challenges can seem, at times,
overwhelming. Without conscious recognition of the purposes, processes and
objectives of the evolutionary plan, the hardships can appear to be unbear-
able and without meaning. Through the portions of human evolutionary his-
tory we have detailed in these writings, you may be able to glimpse the
greater challenges and obstacles involved in the process of evolution, and to
realize that these obstacles do not end with the completion of your physical
lifetime.  
    Y our races have evolved on Earth for 550 million years, and many of
the souls involved in that evolution have had to return time and again,
trapped within cycles of birth, death and rebirth. Immortality, freedom from
death, disease and pain are the natural birthrights of your species. You will not be
able to reclaim these rights until you come to comprehend the greater reality
structures within which your evolution takes place, for through this compre-
hension you will learn to make choices that bring you joy and harmony,
health and freedom. If you are unaware of these greater reality structures you
will be unable to use them wisely, and it will seem as if the greater reality is,
instead, using you. You will feel powerless, and while you feel powerless and
             victimized by circumstance you cannot know freedom.   
             In view of the history we have provided, you may be able to see that
the Sphere of Amenti holds great importance to the evolution of your race,
for it holds the morphogenetic (form-holding) blueprint through which your
race consciousness manifests. You have learned that earthly consciousness is
directly affected by the condition and structure of the physical body and bio-
energetic systems, and that the DNA imprint which sets the biological struc-
ture for the body, is directly manifested through a morphogenetic field. The
personal morphogenetic field directs the design of the DNA, and thus the
body and the quality of consciousness that will be expressed through that
body. The personal morphogenetic field exists within the larger morphoge-
netic fields of the race and the species. The species morphogenetic field is the
Sphere of Amenti. The Sphere of Amenti connects the human species to
the greater morphogenetic field of the Earth, which, in turn, is connected to
the morphogenetic field of planet Tara in HU-2. In order for Earth, and

    Ascension Mechanics  
humanity, to evolve out of HU-1 and into the higher dimensional fields of
HU-2, the frequency patterns of dimensions four, five and six from HU-2
must be brought into manifest expression within the energetic grid of Earth.
These frequencies, or  sound tones , must also become operational within the
active DNA strands of Earth’s people. The energetic imprint of the DNA is
carried within the personal morphogenetic field and consciousness after phys-
ical death of the body. Whatever frequencies are contained within that
imprint will determine the dimensional placement of the consciousness after
death.  
    If freedom from the con fines and struggles of HU-1 is what one desires,
then it is wise to pay attention to the amount of frequencies contained within
the physical DNA, while one is still alive in body. Humanity has the power to
evolve consciously and thus more rapidly, by learning how to use the bio-ener-
getic system to build the needed frequencies into the DNA. This is a personal
responsibility , and although guardians from HU-2 can assist in this process, the
ultimate success of DNA building lies in the hands of the embodied conscious-
ness who directs this process by the way in which personal energy is used and
applied. The greater the amount of the 12-strand DNA imprint that can be
activated within the body’s DNA, the greater the amount of conscious aware-
ness and multidimensional knowledge that will be available to the conscious-
ness while it is physically embodied and after death.  
    Through this knowledge, greater joy can be created while living on Earth,
and following the death transition, the consciousness will be able to focus in
higher dimensions of reality. In order to end the cycle of rebirth in HU-1, an
identity must possess a fifth-dimensional level of consciousness, the particle
substance of the consciousness must pulsate at the speed of fifth-dimensional
frequency. The fifth strand of DNA must be fully assembled, and the lower-
dimensional DNA strands must be fully activated and aligned. An identity that
undergoes the death transition without assembly of the fifth DNA strand
imprint will continue evolution in the fourth-dimensional astral planes. If that
identity does not have the lower-dimensional strands fully assembled, it will
have to experience rebirth in HU-1, in order to fully assemble the lower strand
imprints. An identity that can fully assemble strands 1-5 while still within the
body will be able to merge its molecular particles with those of its anti-particle
double, and transmute the body itself into the higher-dimensional fields of HU-
2, literally transcending the experience of physical death. The human body was
originally designed to be immortal.  
    The process of DNA  transmutation does not only involve the personal
identity. As we have illustrated throughout our historical account, the ability
to ascend is also directly in ﬂuenced by the conditions of the race morphoge-
netic field, and by the Root or Cloister Race into which one is born. The
Sixth Cloister Melchizedek race holds the full imprint for the fifth DNA
108 
                                                                 

                                                                                   Humanity ’ s Evolution
strand, and several hybrid race strains contain the full l2-strand DNA pack-
age in dormant form. Individuals possessing these genetic codes have a per-
sonal advantage in terms of ascension, if their codes are fully activated. ln
order to be born into bodies with the advanced genetic lines these souls,
(unless they are over-souls or avatars birthing directly from HU-3 and
above), had to evolve through incarnations carrying the smaller gene-code
imprint, in order to attain the frequencies within their consciousness that
would allow them energetic compatibility with the larger gene-code body. In
other words, humans with larger gene-code imprints have earned this privi-
lege through their evolutionary progression, just as present-day souls within
smaller gene-code bodies are in the process of evolving into larger gene-code
bodies. All human souls are involved with the exact same process of evolving the
genetic package and consciousness to higher-dimensional levels; some souls are just
further along in this journey.  
    Humans carrying the larger gene-code packages are a gift to other
evolving souls, because, as they assemble their fifth and higher DNA strands,
they pull higher-dimensional frequency into the Earth’s grid. Once this
higher-dimensional frequency reaches a certain peak concentration within
the Earth’s grid, the race morphogenetic field/Sphere of Amenti opens into
the Earth’s core morphogenetic field, and the individual race morphogenetic
fields open into the Sphere of Amenti collective. At this point within the
energy mechanics, the Earth’s grid begins transmitting fifth-dimensional fre-
quency directly into the bio-energetic fields of everyone on the planet. This
infusion of fifth-dimensional frequency then sets the energetic imprint for the
fifth DNA strand within all of the races, even those whose personal, organic
morphogenetic imprint did not originally contain the fifth DNA strand.
Because of the races with the larger gene-code packages, the entire species
has the opportunity to rapidly evolve this larger DNA imprint and to trans-
mute the limitations of the genetic codes with which they were born.  
    The ability to fully transmute the personal genetic imprint is not always
available on Earth. It is dependent upon whether or not enough of the larger
gene-code races are present on the Earth, which is dependent upon whether
or not the Earth’s energetic grid vibrates high enough to sustain a concentra-
tion of beings with higher frequency genetic codes. If the Earth vibration is
too low, due to imbalances in its bio-energetic systems, souls carrying higher
frequency energies cannot birth onto the planet, for the frequencies con-
tained within their bio-energetic fields would literally overload the Earth’s
grid and cause it to collapse. The evolution of DNA within the races is dependent
upon the vibrational evolution of the Earth.  If the condition of the Earth’s bio-
energetic field is poor, due to pollution and abuse of its natural environment
and digression of the consciousness upon the planet, Earth cannot sustain a
concentration of high-frequency soul essence. This also means that Earth
cannot hold the UHF of the Sphere of Amenti at its core. If the Sphere of

Ascension Mechanics  
Amenti is not within the Earth’s core, its frequencies cannot be opened into
the Earth’s grid, and thus the bio-energetic fields of the races will not receive
an infusion of fifth-dimensional frequency. It is the infusion of fifth-dimen-
sional frequency that allows the imprint for the fifth DNA strand to manifest
within all races. Thus in order for the races to have the opportunity for accel-
eration of evolution, Earth must be able to sustain a concentration of souls
with higher frequency gene codes and be able to hold the Sphere of Amenti
at its core. The Earth grid must be in balance for this evolutionary accelera-
tion of the races to occur.  
                                      
                                       EARTH TIME CYCLES                                         
                                            Morphogenetic Waves  
    There are only certain points within each 26,556-year cycle of time
that the Earth grid reaches a vibration rate high enough to accommodate an
infusion of fifth-dimensional energy. It is during these times that Earth can
sustain larger concentrations of higher-frequency souls, and thus it is only
during these periods that the Sphere of Amenti can be fully opened within
the Earth core, to allow assembly of the fifth DNA strand for all of the races.
There are other periods, such as during the time of Pharaoh Akhenaton,
when the Sphere can be returned to Earth core and the Halls of Amenti
opened. But the full frequency patterns of the Sphere of Amenti can be trans-
mitted through Earth’s grid only during the periods of dimensional blending
that occur four times in each 26,556-year cycle. Akhenaton was able to open
the Halls of Amenti and orchestrate ascension only for those individuals who
had the fifth DNA strand imprint, but he could not release the Sphere of
Amenti directly into the D-2 Earth core morphogenetic field to create mass
DNA assembly and ascension. During the four periods in a 26,556-year cycle
when dimensional blending occurs, certain energetic conditions take place
within the morphogenetic fields of the planet that do not occur at any other
time. During these periods, the energetic grid of Earth fuses with the ener-
getic grid of its double within the parallel universe, or with its counterpart’s
parallel double from the next Harmonic Universe up. In the first 4,426-year
cycle of the 26,556-year cycle, Earth fuses twice with its own double in HU-
1, once at the half-point in the 4,426-year period and once at the end of that
period. These two time periods are called Primary Conjunction Points.  In
the last 4,426-year cycle of the 26,556-year cycle Earth fuses twice with its
HU-2 counterpart double, once at the half-point and once at the end of that
4,426-year period. The two time periods when Earth fuses with its counter-
part double are called Primary Coordinate Points.  T ara is Earth’s HU-2
counterpart, so, during the Primary Coordinate Points, Earth’s grid fuses with
the energetic grid of parallel Tara. The two 4,426-year cycles at the begin-
ning and end of a 26,556-year cycle, in which Primary Conjunction Points

                                                                                                                Earth Time Cycles
and Primary Coordinate Points occur, are collectively referred to as  Ascen-
sion Cycles.  Ascension cycles occur only twice within a 26,556-year Har-
monic Time Cycle. Earth fuses with its double twice within the first 4,426
years after entering a 26,556-year Harmonic Time Cycle. Earth fuses twice
with its counterpart double parallel Tara, once after being in the 26,556-year
cycle for 24,343 years (half-cycle Coordinate Point in the second ascension
cycle) and once after completing the full 26,556 years of the Harmonic Time
Cycle, at the end of the second ascension cycle.  
    When Earth encounters its first Coordinate Point within the second
Ascension Cycle, all of its particles that are composed of the overtone fre-
quencies of dimensions one, two and three merge and fuse with the anti-par-
ticles of parallel Tara that are composed of the base-tone frequencies of
dimensions four, five and six within the parallel dimensional scale of HU-2.
As Earth’s particles fuse with Tara’s anti-particles, both particles and anti-par-
ticles enter hyper-space ; they momentarily return to their higher-dimem
sional morphogenetic fields. Earth’s D-1 overtone particles return to their D-
15 morphogenetic field, the D-2 particles return to D-14 and D-3 particles
return to D-13. Tara’s D-4 anti-particles return to their morphogenetic fields
in D-12, the D-5 anti-particles return to D-11 and the D-6 anti-particles
return to D-10.  
    When the particles and anti-particles again leave the morphogenetic
field, they reverse their spin and polarity, shift their angle of rotation by 45°,
and then return to the frequency bands of one Harmonic up. D-1 particles re-
appear as anti-particles within the fourth-dimensional frequency bands, D-2
particles re-appear as anti-particles within the fifth-dimensional frequency
bands and D-3 particles re-appear as anti-particles within the D-6 frequency
bands. Earth’s particles shift from HU-1 into Tara in HU-2. Tara’s anti-parti-
cles also reverse spin and polarity, and re-appear one Harmonic Universe up.
Tara’s D-4 anti-particles reappear as particles in D-7, D-5 anti-particles
become non-matter-based particles in D-8 and D-6 anti-particles reappear as
non-matter-based particles in D-9. Tara’s anti-particles shift from HU-2 into
Gaia’s etheric matter body in HU-3 This transformation of particles consti-
tutes a full shift of Earth’s overtone particles from the time cycles of the parti-
cle universe in Harmonic Universe 1, into the time cycles in the parallel/
anti-particle universe in Harmonic Universe 2.  
    T ara’ s base-tone anti-particles simultaneously shift from the time cycles
of the anti-particle universe in HU-2, into the time cycles of the etheric par-
ticle universe in HU-3. This is the process by which planetary bodies (and
the life-forms residing upon them) evolve their matter particles and anti-par-
ticles upward through the l5-dimensional scale, from dense matter solidity to
pure, non-matter-based conscious energy substance. Ascension through the
time cycles represents the progressive acceleration of particle and anti-parti-
cle pulsation speeds, created through the systematic merging of particles and
111 
                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                              

 Ascension Mechanics  
anti-particles, from the lowest dimensions to the highest, within the 15-
dimensional scale.  
    The progressive release of particles and anti-particles into the morpho-
genetic field at the Primary Coordinate Points in the second ascension cycle
constitutes the release of a particle/anti-particle wave of energy. This parti-
cle/anti-particle energy wave is called a morphogenetic wave.  The morpho-
genetic wave represents the energy released as particles and anti-particles
fuse, exploded into the morphogenetic field/hyper-space and undergo fission
and replication, through which they re-appear in expanded form within the
dimensional frequency fields of the next highest Harmonic Universe.
    At the beginning of a 4,426-year second ascension cycle, the Earth draws
patterns of frequency into its morphogenetic field at Earth’s D-2 core from the
dimensional Uni fied Field of energy. When Earth approaches the half-point in
the cycle, the core morphogenetic field has expanded to its full capacity of
energy holding. About 15 to 20 years before the half-cycle point the Earth’s
energetic grid begins to interact with that of Tara, just as the Earth’s core mor-
phogenetic field reaches full energy-holding capacity and explodes, releasing a
rush of energy through the Earth’s grid. As this energy is released, the particles
carrying overtone frequencies begin merging with Tara’s anti-particles carrying
base-tone frequencies. As Earth’s particles and Tara’s anti-particles progres-
sively merge, they enter hyper-space and transmute into their respective
dimensional morphogenetic fields. 
    This particle/anti-particle transmutation progressively accelerates, as the
energetic grids of Earth and Tara come into alignment, transmuting more and
more overtone particles and base-tone anti-particles into the morphogenetic
fields. The progressive transmutation of particles and anti-particles creates a
building wave of energy moving from Earth and Tara, into the higher-dimen-
sional morphogenetic fields. And like the undertow of a tide, this energy wave
creates a back ﬂow energy wave, from the morphogenetic fields, through which
Earth’s overtone particles re-manifest as Tara’s base-tone anti-particles and
Tara’s base-tone anti-particles re-manifest as Gaia’s particles.  
      The height of the process occurs when the grids of Earth and T ara come
into full alignment at the half-point in the cycle, at which time the morpho-
genetic wave fully crests, and the grids of Earth and Tara begin pulling away
from each other. The crest of the morphogenetic wave begins about five years
before, and extends up to the half-cycle point. During the five-year crest of
the morphogenetic wave, all of Earth’s overtone particles, and Tara’s base-
tone anti-particles, fully transmute into the morphogenetic fields. As Earth’s
overtone particles become progressively suspended in hyper-space and the
dimensional base-tone frequencies left within the Earth’s grid begin to blend
with the overtone anti-particles in Tara's grid, an Harmonic Resonant Tone
is formed. Through the Harmonic Resonant Tone the spin and polarity of
112 
                                                                          

                                                                                     
                                                                                         Earth Time Cycles
Earth’s base-tone particles and Tara’s overtone anti-particles temporarily
reverse, and their angle of rotation shifts 45°. When the polarity of Earth’s
particle base is reversed, Earth’s magnetic poles spin, reverse and shift 45° in
their angle of rotation, and the Earth enters the faster moving parallel time
cycle in the HU-1 anti-particle universe. As this occurs during the five-year
cresting of the morphogenetic wave, Tara’s anti-particles are also going
through a pole reversal and time cycle shift. The electrical fields in Tara’s
grid spin, reverse and shift 45°, and anti-particle Tara shifts into the parallel
time cycle in the HU-2 particle universe.   
        The particle pulsation rate of Earth’ s parallel, anti-particle time cycle in
HU-1 is twice the speed of the same cycle in the HU-1 particle universe. The
particle pulsation rate of Tara’s HU-2 particle time cycle is also twice the
speed of Earth’s particle time cycle. When anti-particle Tara enters its paral-
lel particle time cycle in HU-2, and particle Earth enters its parallel anti-par-
ticle time cycle in HU-1, the two planetary grids are entering the same
particle pulsation rate and thus the same time cycle. Base-tone particle Earth
and overtone anti-particle Tara temporarily merge in the dimensional fre-
quency bands of D-4. As long as the electromagnetic fields of both planets
are in balance, this simultaneous 45° shift in angular rotation and reversal of
polarity in particles and anti-particles will not cause a shift of the physical
Earth on its axis. The electromagnetic fields of each planet keep the fields of
the other in balance. Some ﬂuctuation in Earth’s magnetism may be detected,
and some tectonic movement may occur in areas that are not fully energetic-
cally balanced, but the basic structure of the Earth’s body will remain intact.
If the grids are not balanced, however, a full 45° tilt of Earth’s rotation upon
its axis could result, which would create massive Earth changes.  It is very
important that the Earth’ s bio-energetic structure and electromagnetic grid are bal-
anced during this ﬁve-year period.  
    In this five-year transition during the crest of the morphogenetic wave,
the magnetic grid of particle Earth becomes electrical, and the electrical grid
of anti-particle Tara becomes magnetic. The two planetary grids merge and
some of the land mass contours of Tara emerge on Earth as etheric overtone
structures . When particle Earth returns to its particle time cycle in HU-1,
these land masses will manifest first on the anti-particle Earth, and by the
close of the full ascension cycle 2,213 years later, these new land configure-
tions will manifest physically on the particle Earth. (This is what is meant by
the New Age concept of literal “Atlantis Rising”. These lands of Tara will
indeed rise up on Earth, but normally they will do so progressively over a
period of 2,213 years, not all at once.)  
    At the height of the morphogenetic wave crest, during the half-point
in the cycle, there is an approximately three-day period when Earth’s mag-
netic fields temporarily collapse as the spin of particles and anti-particles
slows, polarity again reverses, and the angle of particle rotation shifts back

45° to its original position. Within that three-day period, particle Earth
returns to its HU-1 time cycle in the particle universe, and anti-particle Tara
returns to its HU-2 time cycle in the HU-2 anti-particle universe. There will
be difficulty with the functioning of earthly electrical and magnetic devices
during this period, and the human mind and body will experience an exces-
sive feeling of tension, pressure and fatigue. Strange atmospheric anomalies
may occur, including a prolonged period of darkness and daylight, and the
possible appearance of a double moon, depending upon the balance of the
Earth’s grid. These symptoms will release as soon as the transfer of time cycles
is completed, but during the three-day period tremendous stress will be
placed upon the human’s body, mind and emotions.  
    Prior to this three-day shifting period, during the five-year crest of the
morphogenetic wave, electrical energy is magnetically pulled from particle
Earth’s core into anti-particle Tara’s core and the fifth-dimensional frequen-
cies of Tara’s core blend into Earth’s D-2 core morphogenetic field. At this
time, the fastest-vibrating base-tone particles of Earth —those that vibrate to
the particle pulsation rate of the fifth-dimensional frequencies—are trans-
ferred from particle Earth’s D-2 core morphogenetic field into anti-particle
Tara’s D-5 morphogenetic field. These mechanics of energy create a ﬂuctua-
tion within the electromagnetic fields of both Tara and Earth, which operate
as a warp in space-time. This naturally occurring time warp serves as a portal
passage between Earth and Tara, which opens at the beginning of the five-
year period, reaches its height of activity during the half-point of the ascen-
sion cycle five years later, then progressively closes from the half-point to its
full closing five years following the half-point.

                 The Holographic Beam, the Photon Belt and the Pleiades  
       
    During the course of this 10-year period, five years prior to and after the
half-point, fifth through ninth-dimensional frequencies are progressively
infused into Earth’s grid, then into the bio-energetic fields of all life-forms on
Earth. The infusion of frequency from the higher-dimensional fields and
Tara’s core in D-5 into Earth's core in D-2 follows a natural path of interdi-
mensional energy circulation, through which HU-1 through HU-5 are con-
nected. Each Harmonic Universe has a Harmonic Time Cycle, such as that
of HU-1, which is 26,556 years long. All of the Harmonic Time Cycles are
synchronized through the particle pulsation rates within each of the 15
dimensions. When Earth enters the half-point in its second ascension cycle,
its grid fuses with the grid of anti-particle Tara precisely because these Har-
monic Time Cycles are synchronized. When Earth reaches its half-point, not
only does a warp in space-time occur within HU-1, it occurs all the way up
through the five Harmonic Universes. A time-warp portal opens all the way

                                                                                   The Holographic Beam
up through the 15-dimensional scale. This opening of interdimensional por-
tals, which creates the morphogenetic wave, allows a beam of UHF energy to
pass from the Meta-galactic Core in D-8, through all of the Harmonic Uni-
verses. We refer to this as the Holographic Beam, for it is the primary spiral
of transmitting energy that feeds and sustains all of the dimensional systems
and the holograms of matter which take place in those systems. The path of
the Holographic Beam follows a particular route into the time cycles of HU-
1. lt spirals down through various planetary cores from HU-2 and HU-3,
through the planetary core of Alcyone in the Pleiades, through various other
planets and then enters your solar system through the core of the sun. From
there the Holographic Beam moves outward and through the cores of the
planets in your solar system. As the planets move within the cycles of their
orbits, at certain points they align with the sun in a particular way, and pass
through the projection of this Holographic Beam.  
    The Holographic Beam is released when the portals open during the
half-point of the ascension cycle and again at the close of the ascension cycle
2213 years later. The Holographic Beam that was released during the ascen~
sion cycle at the end of the previous 26,556-year period leaves its trace
within the HU-1 galaxy. The beam from the past cycle will appear as an area
of concentrated photon activity surrounding the planet Alcyone, through
which the beam entered HU-1. The Holographic Beam follows a path
through the Pleiades to Earth because Earth’s sun is actually the eighth star in
the Pleiadian system. As discussed in earlier chapters, during the cataclysm
550 million years ago, fragments of Tara's morphogenetic field were pulled
through the center of this Pleiadian star. The planets of Earth's solar system,
which are fragments of Tara, then re-formed around this star in HU-1.
(Recent speculation in the private scientific communities suggests that our
solar system is a binary solar system having two suns. Alcyone, the central sun
of the Pleiadian star system is actually the primary sun of our solar system. Our
sun is a star within the Pleiadian solar system.)  The area of photon energy
around the Pleiades has been referred to as the Photon Belt, which was dis-
covered by Earth scientists in 1961 through mechanical observation of that
star system. (Photons are created through the fusion of multidimensional par-
ticles and anti-particles, so the Photon Belt is the residual energy left over
from the last morphogenetic wave. That energy is replenished every 26,556
years as the Holographic Beam projects through Alcyone twice during each
second ascension cycle.)  
     As Earth moves through its next 26,566-year cycle following the release
of the last Holographic Beam, completing a full round of its Harmonic Time
cycle, it will appear as though the Photon Belt is moving closer to Earth and
its solar system. They are actually moving toward each other, as the Pleiades
and the Earth’s solar system travel in their orbits within the HU-1 and HU-2
Harmonic Time cycles. When Earth completes its half-point in the second

Ascension Mechanics  
ascension cycle, its overtone particles will pass into the Photon Belt, just as a
new release of the Holographic Beam takes place. The new release of the
Holographic Beam creates the morphogenetic wave that allows portions of
Earth and Tara to temporarily merge within the fourth dimension. The infu-
sion of Earth’s grid with D-5 through D-9 frequency occurs through the Holo-
graphic Beam. When that energy infusion begins, five years prior to the half-
point, Earth begins passing into the Holographic Beam as it merges with Tara
and enters the D-4 time cycle. As this occurs, Earth’s overtone particles move
into the Photon Belt. While particles and anti-particles reverse polarity and
spin, and the angular rotation of particles shifts 45°, the morphogenetic fields
of D-2 Earth’s core and D-5 Tara’s core come into direct alignment with the
Holographic Beam. The beam allows the D-2 and D-5 planetary core mor-
phogenetic fields to open into each other, which creates an infusion of D-5
frequency into Earth’s grid.  
    At the height of the morphogenetic wave crest, at the half-point in the
cycle, the Holographic Beam is aligned directly through the planetary cores
of Earth, Tara and Gaia for about three days, and the grids of Earth and Tara
are in complete alignment. The Holographic Beam runs from the D-8 Meta-
Galactic Core, upward into the D-9 Galactic Core, then downward, directly
through the cores of Gaia in HU-3, Tara in HU-2 and Earth in HU-1. This
creates an infusion of D-8 and D-9 frequency through the three planetary
grids, and allows an ascension passage from Earth, through Tara and into
Gaia and beyond, to open during the three-day period. The morphogenetic
fields of each planet absorb as much UHF energy from the beam as they can
hold, at which point the morphogenetic wave reaches its full crest and parti-
cle/anti-particle spin begins to slow in preparation for Earth’s return to its
HU-1 time cycle. Particles and anti-particles reverse spin and polarity, and
their angular rotation shifts 45° back to its original position, as Earth begins
to shift out of direct alignment with the Holographic Beam and Tara’s grid.
After a three-day period Earth returns to its HU-1 time cycle and the time
warp portal between D-2 and D-5 begins its five-year closing period, and the
portals between D-9, D-8 and D-7 close. The grids of Earth and Tara begin
their five-year period of moving out of alignment with each other, and Earth’s
overtone particles remain within the Photon Belt. Normally Earth’s overtone
particles would remain within the Photon Belt for 2213 years, until the next
morphogenetic wave, when the base-tone particles would also enter the Pho-
ton Belt and Earth would shift fully into the HU-2, D-4 time cycle to begin
another 26,556-year Harmonic Time cycle.

    During the period of five years prior to and five years after the half-
cycle point, the imprint of the fifth DNA strand is made available to all of
the races, and the opportunity for ascension to Tara is made available to all
who can fully activate that strand before the close of the dimensional time
warp portal five years following the half-point. Ideally, the Sphere of Amenti
race morphogenetic field and the Blue Flame Staff of Amenti, Earth’s portion
of Tara’s morphogenetic field, will be placed within this time-warp portal in
Earth’s D-2 core during the half-point in the second ascension cycle. During
this 10-year period, the Halls of Amenti portal passages to Tara, and to other
time fields of Earth in HU-1, become open to the masses. In order for the
morphogenetic wave, mass ascension and evolutionary leap in time to occur,
the Sphere of Amenti must be held and opened within the D-2 Earth core
morphogenetic field, and the Blue Flame must be embodied within 8% of
Earth’s populations.  
    Individuals whose body , bio-energetic field and consciousness pulsate
at the rate of fifth-dimensional frequency will experientially perceive either
direct, bodily transmutation through a time portal passage from Earth to Tara,
or a time travel transport to Tara via interdimensional spacecraft (arranged
by guardian groups to assist those who cannot quite make it through the
dimensional transmutation of the portals). They will end up on Tara in a
space-time coordinate about 5,532.5 years in the future from Earth’s original
space-time position. At the end of the five-year period following the crest of
the morphogenetic wave, people who have not fully assembled the fifth DNA
strand will find that the assembled portions of that strand begin to disassem-
ble. 
    When Earth returns to its time cycle in the particle universe, the ener-
getic imprint of the fifth DNA strand will remain in their bio-energetic field,
and will manifest within their anti-particle double on parallel Earth, but the
fifth strand will no longer manifest into the person’s operational gene code.
The Halls of Amenti will no longer be passable for such individuals until the
fifth strand slowly assembles over the course of the next several incarnational
cycles within HU-1. These individuals will be stuck in the HU-1 incarna-
tional cycles until they can build the fifth strand or until the next morphoge-
netic wave period 2213 years later, whichever comes first. The Halls of
Amenti will remain passable only to those who organically possessed the fifth
DNA strand imprint. The 10-year period, starting five years before and end-
ing five years after the half-cycle point, allows the races the opportunity for
an evolutionary leap in time. This opportunity occurs only twice in a 26,556-
year cycle, during the second ascension cycle. During this period many

      Ascension Mechanics  
human souls, who cannot fully assemble the fifth strand while embodied, but
have assembled the fourth strand, choose to drop their physical bodies, so
they may rapidly assemble D-5 frequency into their morphogenetic field from
D-4. Such individuals will ascend to Tara as soul essence from D-4, so they do
not have to continue incarnational cycles in HU-l. There are frequently
localized disaster events during these periods through which masses of people
die and leave their bodies at one time. The events may appear tragic from an
earthly perspective, but from the soul perspective participation in these events is
planned in order to catch the morphogenetic wave and ascend.  
    During the five-year period prior to the half-point in the cycle, when
Earth and Tara shift into the fourth-dimensional frequency bands, the part of
Earth’s particles that vibrate/pulsate at D-5 speed, begin to fully transmute
and appear on Tara, within the time cycles of HU-2. The highest vibrating
particles enter hyper-space and re-appear in the future. The portions of
Earth’s particles that pulsate the slowest fall further in vibration at the release
of the higher pulsating particles and drop into the Uni fied Field of the base-
tone frequency patterns of D-1. The slowest vibrating particles break apart
their form construction and re-appear as part of the Earth’s particle-base in
the past, at a time period in the beginning of the present 26,556-year cycle.
The particles pulsating at a middle range rate of speed enter the faster time
cycle of D-4 for five years, then return to their original time cycle in HU-1 to
complete the remaining 2213 years of the ascension cycle. The mid-range
vibration particles appear within the present time continuum in the parallel
anti-particle universe (which is the same time continuum as the D-4 cycle in
the particle universe), then after five years return to their original present D-
