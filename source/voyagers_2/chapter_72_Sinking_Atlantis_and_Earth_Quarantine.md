                                                                              Sinking Atlantis and Earth Quarantine
Sirian Council discovered the plan too late, and were unable to prevent the
catastrophe. But they were able to rescue several groups of Sirian Council
loyalists from the Atlantean Islands, transporting them via interdimensional
craft to Egypt. Fleets rapidly scoured the Earth in the few hours prior to the
explosions, warning the cultures to retreat underground and into the Inner
Earth civilizations, where they would find shelter and refuge from the deluge
that would soon follow. Many people from many lands poured into the Inner
Earth portals, some were not able to enter before the portals had to be closed,
and so they perished. The portals and the underground passageways leading
to them were sealed, closed from the inside using the Ankh tools, as Earth
awaited the inevitable explosions.  
    The first series of explosions blew apart the land mass of the largest
Atlantean Island, which triggered tectonic shifting beneath the ocean ﬂoor.
This set off a series of explosions within the other Crystal Generators, deci-
mating the land mass of the two remaining islands, sending them deep into
the caverns beneath the ocean ﬂoor. Atlantis was removed from the face of
the Earth, into a watery grave within the caverns beneath the ocean floor.
The explosions occurred in 9558 BC, and resulted in yet another tilt of the
Earth's axis, shifting of some global land masses, a series of earthquakes and
massive ﬂooding in some locations (the ﬂooding was not global as it had been
during previous ﬂoods). The Giza teleport station was again thrown out of
alignment, as the Earth's vortex beneath it (Earth's “heart chakra”) no longer
energetically lined up properly with the Alcyone spiral. Though portions of
the Great Pyramid, the Sphinx and several other structures did survive these
Earth changes, it would be many years before they were returned to their
grandeur. The guardian races had more pressing problems with which to con-
tend.  
     After the explosions beneath Atlantis ceased, the Sirian Council ordered
the Sirian Blue Race to remove the crystal generators which had not
exploded. The massive crystals were dredged from the ocean floor and
returned to Sirius B. With the removal of the crystals, humanity's technologi-
cal abilities were thrown into the dark ages, and the once glorious civiliza-
tions of Earth were reduced to primitive organizations based upon survival
concerns and built through manual labor. Though the memory of advanced
societal structure remained, its applications became impossible without the
powers supplied through advanced extraterrestrial technologies. The crystals
were removed as a safety precaution, so more explosions did not ensue, but
later it was decided that these technologies would not be returned to Earth
until the races had evolved to a more mature comprehension of the proper
use of power. But this was only the beginning of the problems humanity
would face as a result of the sinking of Atlantis.  
       Following the deluge, the Sirian Council placed further security seals on
the Arc of the Covenant, which no longer permitted energy to be drawn
