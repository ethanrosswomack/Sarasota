    The Angelic Human Heritage
   and Rainbow Roundtables
  •  Our mystical teachings and religions of today emerged from the distant past
      of the Pre-Atlantian era. Mystical and religious teachings have covertly
   directed evolving humanity toward very specific objectives; objectives
    pertaining to a Hidden Sacred Mission of Planetary Guardianship that the
     Angelic Human race was seeded on Earth to fulfill. Originally all mystical
     and religious teachings were intended to guide us toward fulfillment of this
     Sacred Mission, but due to intentional distortions of Sacred Spiritual-Sci-
    ence texts many of the ancient spiritual education systems now mislead
   humanity into creating the opposite of what our original Sacred Mission
     intended.  
  •  In exploring the realities of our ancient “Forbidden History”  we rediscover
 the true origins and nature  of the Angelic Human race . In rediscovering
 our true origins and nature we reclaim our memory of the original Sacred
  Mission of Planetary Guardianship that our race has come to Earth to
  fulfill and the methods of Divine Spiritual-Science Mechanics  by which
 our Sacred Mission can be successfully accomplished.  
 •  The keys to understanding our present-time global drama  are hidden within
       the ancient Secrets of Lemurian and Atlantian civilization.  T o under-
       stand the significance of the Lemurian and Atlantian Empires of the more
        recent past, we need to move further back in time to the initial civiliza-
       tions of 12-Tribes Angelic Human Seeding-3 , the origins of the present
        Angelic Human race. Through knowledge of our origins we will rediscov-
       er what our race came to Earth to accomplish. Identifying the Original Di-
       vine Objective  of the Angelic Human race will enable us to examine
        spiritual and mystical creeds more clearly , with an eye toward differenti-
       ating between what leads us toward or away from our race’s Original Di-
          vine Objective.

       PRIESTS OF UR, AND INDIGO CHILD EIEYANI GRAIL LINE
      Throughout the long history of the Founder Race “ Angelic Wars ” 250
billion-570 million years ago,  the Emerald Order Elohei-Elohim Anuhazi
Feline-hominids, Gold Order Seraphei-Seraphim Cerez  Avian-hominid and
Aethien  Mantis and Amethyst Order Bra-ha-Rama Inyu  Cetacean and
Pegasai Winged-horse-deer  races worked to restore Universal Star Gates 11
and 12. Following destruction of Lyra-Aramatena and Star Gate-12, the
Emerald Order Breneau and their Elohei-Elohim Feline-hominid races were
appointed by the Yanas Collectives from beyond the Time Matrix, to serve as
the Primary Universal Templar Security  T eam in our Time Matrix. The Elo-
hei Emerald Order Feline-hominids were commissioned to organize and assist
guardian nations in securing the Universal Templar Complex from Fallen
Angelic Race dominion, and to implement genetic Bio-Regenesis Programs
to assist fallen races in re-evolving their original potentials of ascension.
Upon request of the Yanas Collectives, the Density-5 Breneau Orders and
their Emerald Order Anuhazi Feline-hominids, Gold Order Cerez Avian-
hominids and Aethien Mantises and Amethyst Order Inyu Cetaceans and
Pegasai Winged-horse-deer races created the universal service organization
called the lnterdimensional Association of Free Worlds-IAFW.  
         In order to provide greater protection and healing efforts in our Time
Matrix, Emerald Order Elohei-Elohim Anuhazi  Feline-hominids, Gold
Order Seraphei-Seraphim Cerez Avian-hominids and Amethyst Order Bra-
ha-Rama Inyu Cetaceans  (forefathers of the Whale and aquatic Dolphin)
co-created a new guardian-healer race called the Azurites. The Azurites  are
a blue-skinned land-water mammal feline-avian hominid, some bearing
feathered heads and wings, which were created 250 billion years ago with
the formation of the IAFW.  The Azurite Race, carrying the full spectrum of
the three Founders Race’s original core genetic templates or ''Ascension
Codes,'' represented a new “ Yani ” (meaning “Yanas embodied”) race-form
through which the Density-5 Breneau and Yanas Ascended Masters Collec-
tives from beyond the Time Matrix could incarnate directly into the density
systems. The Azurite Yani race line was simultaneously seeded into every
Density Level in our 15-dimensional Time Matrix, placed in galactic and
planetary proximity to the 12 Universal Star Gates  of our Universal T em-
plar Complex. The Azurite Yani race was placed under the guidance of the
Emerald Order Breneau Elohei-Elohim Feline-hominid Universal Security
Team. The Azurites were appointed by the Yanas and Density-5 Breneau
Orders as the Azurite Universal Templar Security Team , commissioned to
protect and repair the structural integrity of our Time Matrix and with assist-
ing all races in their evolution to ascension and freedom from the Time
Matrix.

                                   The Azurites, IAFW/, Oraphim-Angelic Human...
         About 570 Million years ago , the Angelic Wars between the fallen
Annu-Elohim Anyu aquatic-apes and Bipedal Dolphin People and fallen Ser-
aphim Insect, Omicron-Dragon-Moth, Dino and Odedicron-Lizard races had
escalated to the point of potentially imploding this Time Matrix. The
Breneau Orders of Density-5, with assistance from the Azurites and Emerald
Covenant races in the Time Matrix, repaired Star Gates 11 and 12. Able to
implement direct access to our Time Matrix once again, the Density-5
Breneau Orders intervened, offering the second restatement of the Emerald
Covenant , through which members of any of the races could re-enter co-cre-
ative, co-evolution agreements.  
    Many of the fallen Seraphim Insect, Drakon-Moth and Lizard races and
some of the Annu-Elohim Dolphin People and Anyu Aquatic Ape races
entered this peace treaty. Fallen races entering the Emerald Covenant
restatement 570 million years ago agreed to work together under the direc-
tion of the Elohei-Elohim Anuhazi Feline-hominid, Seraphei-Seraphim
Cerez Avian-hominid and Aethien Mantis and Bra-ha-Rama Inyu Cetacean
and Pegasai Winged-horse-deer races. As per the Emerald Covenant restate-
ment 570 million years ago, the Azurites and Emerald Covenant guardian
races would assist fallen races to reverse-mutate their faltering genetic tem-
plates. In return for this guardian race assistance, regenerated fallen races
would assist guardian races to restore the integrity of the Universal and Inter-
planetary Templar Complexes and bring peace to our Time Matrix. Races
entering the Emerald Covenant restatement agreed to allow the Breneau
Orders to incarnate into our Time Matrix by entering another new life form
that would, like the Azurites, carry the genetic imprint of all stellar Founder
Races.  
     This new life form, which would also harbor the consciousness of the
Breneau Orders and Yanas Ascended Masters Collectives in manifest
form, would serve as the embodied, commissioned Keepers of the Univer-
sal Templar Complex, assisting all stellar races in ful filling their potentials
of ascension and freedom from the Time Matrix . The new guardian race,
intended to evolve to relieve the Azurite Yani of their long tour in density ,
would bring the co-creation agreements of the original Emerald Covenant of
Aramatena  back into play . The new race was intended to become the next
generation of the Universal Templar Security Team in our Time Matrix. Cre-
ation of the new race was intended to be a “ changing of the guard,”  through
which the Azurite Yani could transfer their commission in time to the new
race and ascend out of the Time Matrix to return to At-One-ment with
Source. This new race was created with the intention of embodying and
restoring to the races of our Time Matrix, peace, love and harmonious, coop-
erative evolution. Like the Azurite Yani, this new biological race would
present a genetically perfected form  through which the consciousness of any
stellar collective could incarnate to reclaim the original integrity of its
Ascension Codes ; the new race was called the Turaneusiam  or the Angelic

  The Angelic Human Heritage and Rainbow Roundtables  
Human  of Density-2 T ara. The seed race for the Angelic Human was the
Densities 2-4 Oraphim,  meaning “ Children of the Light”  in reference to
their Breneau Order creators of the Density-5 (dimensions 13-14-15) Kee-
Ra-ShA Primal Light Fields.               
        CREATION OF THE ORAPHIM-TUR ANEUSIAM ANGELIC  
                        HUMAN CHRISTIAC-RISHIC GRAIL LINE  
     The Oraphim are a hybrid form of Lyra -Sirius A Anuhazi  (Elohei Emer-
ald Order Feline-Hominid), Sirius B Azurite Yani  (Elohei Feline-hominid,
Seraphei Avian-hominid and Bra-ha-Rama Inyu Cetacean) and Pleiadian
Serres  (Density-2 Seraphei A vian-hominid). The Oraphim  were seeded 568
million years ago  on Density-3 Sirius B, Procyon, Orion-Mintaka and Gaia
and Density-2 Sirius B, Pleiadian-Alcyone, Altair and Tara,  to begin cre-
ation of the Angelic Human  lineage. At the time of their creation 568  
million years ago,  a specialized group of Oraphim were further hybridized with
the Azurite Yani race of Sirius B, to create the Azurite-Oraphim “Blue
Human” Maharaji  lineage of Sirius B, the progenitors of the Christiac -
Maji-Indigo Child Grail Line on Earth.  The Sirius B Maharaji Azurite-Ora-
phim genetic line became further intertwined with the Turaneusiam Angelic
Human lineage of Tara 550 million years ago  through Bio-Regenesis pro-
grams  for the faltering Taran Oraphim-Turaneusiam Human race line.  
      One branch of the Maharaji Azurite-Oraphim human race line of T ara
became the Melchizedek Cloister Priests of UR Grail Line . The Taran MC
Priests of Ur Angelic Human Grail Line families became members of the
Azurite Universal Templar Security Team  and founded the egalitarian
Priesthood of Ur and the  original Azurite Temple of the Melchizedek
Cloister universal service organization on Tara. Another branch of the Taran
Maharaji Azurite-Oraphim lineage, the Ur-Tarranates,  seeded the 12-Tribes
Earth Angelic Human  lineage 250-25 million years ago. (For more informa-
tion on Indigo Children-Maharaji-MC Priest of UR Christiac Grail Lines ,
see Voyagers Volume 1, 2nd Edition). The original Lyran-Sirian-Pleiadian
Oraphim  prototype is a thin, 12-20 feet tall androgynous  feline-avian-
human land-water mammal “ Breatherian ” (does not eat; draws nourishment
directly from the atmosphere in which it is placed).  
     The original Oraphim have translucent deep tan or powder-white to
pale-blue skin, elongated skulls, petite, childlike  facial features, six fingers
and toes, and no ears or small cat-like ears on the side of the head. Some
have small cat-like lips and with a split in the upper lip and a feline nose ,
others have small, thin lips  with a mild downward dip in the upper lip that
resembles the shape of a tiny bird beak, with a petite human-child-like nose.
Some Oraphim have pure white head hair  resembling long, soft fur, others
are bald or have soft, white-feathered skulls.  All have hairless bodies and
large, slanted almond-shaped eyes of golden, electric blue or violet hue,

                                                                        Creation of the Oraphim-Turaneusiam...
with pure white vertical pupils , thin eyelids with fine white eyelashes and
no eyebrows . 
     Several specialized Oraphim strains are more Feline, A vian or Cetacean
in biological structure. Specialized Emerald Order Elohei-Elohim Oraphim
strains appear as large upright feline-hominids with pure white fur cover-
ing the body , non-clawed paws and tails; Oraphim felines resemble the
white Persian cat species  of Earth and they often overshadow  this earthly
feline of their genetic association to interact with Density-1 Earth. Special-
ized Gold Order Seraphei-Seraphim Oraphim closely resemble the Eagle and
Swan avian species of Earth, having smaller eyes, wings and avian-hominid
bodies covered with pure white, soft blue-gray or jet black feathers . Spe-
cialized Amethyst Order Bra-ha-Rama Oraphim  are Cetacean, most  closely
resembling the Aquatic Dolphin and Whale specie s of Earth. Unlike the
Bipedal Dolphin People of the fallen Anu-Elohim, the Oraphim Cetaceans
do not have arms or legs , and though capable of breathing air or water, they
are designed for mobility in ﬂuid, not on land.  
     The Oraphim Cetaceans are pure white or pale-light-blue  in color, and
specialize in transmitting the sound  tones that hold the scalar-wave temples
for universal structure in order . The Oraphim Cetaceans created several
Dolphin and Whale species on Earth, to serve as their emissaries in maintain-
ing Earth’s biosphere. The fallen Annu-Elohim Bipedal Dolphin People have
also seeded several strains of  Dolphin, Whale and Shark species into Earth’s
biosphere, in attempt to gain sonic control over Earth’s Manifestation Tem-
plate. Though it is nearly impossible to detect the differences between the
Oraphim Cetacean and Annu-Elohim Cetacean species, there are a few sub-
tle differences  observable between them. Oraphim Cetacean  strains tend to
be lighter in skin color , are more vegetarian in diet, prefer warmer waters ,
are more receptive to human contact , have a more gentle, feminine mater-
nal nature and emit higher-pitched sound frequencies  than their fallen
Annu-Elohim Cetacean kin.  
     In their organic state , when they are not intermingling with other race
strains for the purpose of assisting in DNA Bio-Regenesis programs, the Ora-
phim Feline-Avian-Cetacean-Humans have full conscious power  over phys-
ical manifestation and de-manifestation, allowing them adaptability to
almost any environment and Density Level in which they are placed. The
Oraphim can “shape-shift” at will, and their biological forms are immortal
until they fully transmute out of the Time Matrix. After ascending out of the
Time Matrix, an Oraphim must rebirth in a new immortal body form to reen-
ter the Density systems of the Time Matrix. Though they are biologically
androgynous and do not have external manifestations of gender difference,
the “ male ” Oraphim  form carries a stronger electrical field and specializes in
electrical transmission of energy , while the “ female” Oraphim  form carries
a stronger magnetic field and specializes in magnetic reception of energy .
Like the Azurites, in combining of male-female bio-energetic fields, the Ora-
267 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

The Angelic Human Heritage and Rainbow Roundtables  
phim have the greatest ability of any race in our Time Matrix to transmit and
receive the frequencies of the electromagnetic Primal Life Force Currents in
our Time Matrix. This energy reception-transmission ability makes them bio-
logically able to perform intensive structural repair of the universal mani-
festation template  in our Time Matrix, allowing them the capacity to ful fill
their creation commission as evolving guardians and Keepers of the Univer-
sal Templar Complex.  
     Oraphim can procreate independently,  but prefer procreation through
fusion or coupling of the bio-energetic fields of gender-twin mates . During
Oraphim procreation an energetic birth sack  is painlessly expelled from the
navel region of either male or female. The energetic sack contains cellular mat-
ter formed through the combined genetic imprint of the parents, or a replica of
the singular parent’s genetic imprint. Once the sack is expelled from the body,
the new incarnating Oraphim soul begins fetal integration. Gestation of the
Oraphim birth sack varies, depending upon the environment into which they
incarnate. The birth sack is placed within a planetary soil “nest,” then into a
water or fluid environment organic to the planet, allowing the incarnating
Oraphim to adopt the natural template structures characteristic to the envi-
ronmental system into which it is incarnating. After water or ﬂuid gestation,
the Oraphim embryo rapidly grows to the size of a human child of 8-12 years,
and emerges from the birth sack, fully sentient, mobile, telepathic and with full
regional spoken language capacity . The Oraphim race is the Seed Race from
which the Angelic Human Turaneusiam  emerged, and represents the state of
evolutionary fulfillment in time toward which all human races are re-evolving.
Like the Azurite Yani, the Oraphim race has a 24-48 Strand DNA Template ,
which embodies the full spectrum Ascension Codes through which transmuta-
tive ascension out of the Time Matrix can be achieved.  
    The Oraphim Seed Race of T ara represents the genetic ancestral heritage
from which the Turaneusiam Angelic Human 12-Strand DNA Template
emerged 560 million years ago  on Density-2 (dimension 4-5-6) T ara. The
Taran Turaneusiam Angelic Human is the genetic ancestral lineage  from
which the “Turaneusiam-2” 12-Tribes Angelic Human race line was seeded on
Earth 250-25 million years ago.  Contemporary humanity is part of  Angelic
Human 12-Tribes Seeding-3;  the first 2 seedings of the Angelic Human 12-
Tribes on Earth were destroyed through progressive infiltration and warring
with Fallen Angelic (“ET”) races. 12-Tribes Seeding-3 began in 798,0001 BC,
with introduction of the five Palaidia-Urtite Cloister  races, who composed the
first 12 simultaneous settlements  of the Seeding-3 12-Tribes. The Palaidia
Races are referred to as “ Maji Grail Line Angelic Humans ,” possessing 24-48
Strand DNA Templates  characteristic to the Lyran-Sirian-Oraphim Angelic
Human genome. From the five Palaidia Urtite-Cloister Seed Races  of
798,000 BC, Seeding-3 of the 12-Strand DNA Template Angelic Human  lin-

    eage was progressively orchestrated on Earth, as part of a larger trans-time
                 Sacred Mission of Planetary Guardianship.  
    Members of the Palaidia Maji Grail Line Races have repeatedly incar-
   nated  during various periods of Seeding-3 Angelic Human evolution, to keep
  the 12-Strand and Maji Grail Line DNA Template potential alive within
  the Earth Human gene pool. The Angelic Human and Maji Grail Line gene
   pool has been kept alive on Earth to enable the Angelic Humans to complete
  the “ Sacred Mission ” which humanity had been seeded on Earth to ful fill.
  The Palaidia Maji Grail Line races have been incarnating on contemporary
  Earth  for the past 100 years ; they are referred to as the '' Indigo Children -
   T ypes 1 and 2.  The term “ Indigo Children ” refers to the frequencies of the
 6th-dimensional wave band, the Indigo wavelength  of the 15-Dimensional
  Spectrum.  Maji Grail Line Indigo Children are born with the 6th-Strand
  T emplate  of their 24-48 Strand DNA  T emplates activated at birth , whereas
  Angelic Humans with 12-Strand DNA  T emplates are born with three strands
  of 12 activated. Activation of the 6th-DNA  Strand T emplate allows the D-6
  Indigo wave spectra  and the D-6 consciousness  characteristic to this wave-
  length, to embody within the Indigo Child fetal body . The Palaidia Race
  Angelic Human Maji Grail Line Indigo Children T ypes-1 and 2 have been
   progressively incarnating on Earth in preparation for the Sacred Mission  of
  the long awaited 2000-2017 Stellar Activations Cycle.                        
           SEEDING THE 12 URTITE-CLOISTER PALAIDA EMPIRES  
    The secrets to unraveling the riddles of contemporary humanity’s origins 
and heritage lies in the distant past, within the first 12 Palaidia Empires  of
Urtite-Cloister races , through which the five Urtite-Cloister , five Cloister  
and 7 Root Races  (See  ''Root Races - Cloistered Races'' on page 15) of the
Angelic Human lineage emerged to commence Seeding-3  of the 12-Tribes . 
Each of the 12 Palaidia Empires  were constructed simultaneously , under-
ground, beginning in 798,000 BC . The Palaidia Empires were founded by
the five Seed Races  of the 25-48 Strand DNA  T emplate Maji Priest-King
Holy Grail Line  as its members incarnated through the Urtite-Cloister  
Angelic Human Host Race  of Seeding-3 (See page 56).  
            The Seeding-3 Urtite-Cloister Host races were seeded following the 
   organizational pattern set by the 549,998,000 BC  Taran Covenant of
   Palaidor  (See Page 6) which was previously utilized in both the Seeding-2
   Dagos-Cloister  and Seeding-1 Ur-Tarranate Palaidorian-Cloister Host   
   Race seedings. In accordance with the traditional race-seeding format, the
