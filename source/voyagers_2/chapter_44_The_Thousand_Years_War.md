human populace.  These intrusive Visitors of Dracos lineage are in reality a
hybrid mutation of our human ancestors who evolved within the Orion star
system. As they are members of the human lineage they feel entitled to use
the territories of Earth, even though their race was banned from here nearly
850,000 years ago by the Breneau. Like most Sirian-Anunnaki strains, the
Dracos also carry the genetic configuration of the “666” Templar-Axion Seal
(previously discussed). The soul essence of the Dracos is part human and part
Drakon.  
    The Drakon and their creations became a menace to the developing
races, and so plans were orchestrated to dispose of the Drakon problem.
About 956,500 years ago, with the assistance of Anunnaki Visitors from Sir-
ius A, the races jointly employed a plan of using the power within the Earth's
grid to destroy the underground habitats of the Drakon and their monitors.
The plan back fired, creating an explosion within the Earth's crust, which cre-
ated climatic anomalies, ﬂooding, a slight pole tilt, destruction of part of the
land masses and finally a small period of global ice that ended about 950,000
years ago. Most of the Drakon left Earth during this period or were destroyed
by climatic conditions. Most of the human races retreated underground, cre-
ating sophisticated cultures beneath the Earth's crust, some races being per-
mitted to enter the portals of the Inner Earth. Once environmental
conditions stabilized, many races returned to surface life, rebuilding their civ-
ilizations. Though most of the Drakon had vacated or perished, they left a
legacy of genetic distortion behind them, that threatened the continuation of
the human lineage.  
    Earth-animal interbreeding became a problem in the races of the Second
Seeding and Host Matrix Transplants  (see V oyagers I , 2e, p. 76.) were being
used to realign the human genetic codes. The races of Amenti began to digress
further due to Drakon contamination of the genetic lines, and several other ET
races used this opportunity to experiment with the human evolutionary
imprint. Some of the more primitive human-like forms of “early man” arose
from such experiments, as did some of the apelike human varieties. But the
human lineage did not originate from these primitive forms. These forms
emerged from the distorted human imprint. Many such mutations were also
created prior to the Electric Wars. The Lamanian and Atlanian cultures frag-
mented, became factions and began warring. The Atlanians of the Second
Seeding were in ﬂuenced by descendants of the Sirian-Anunnaki race from
HU-2 (which later evolved for a time on HU-1 planet Mars), the same race
that had instigated the Taran Templar Solar Initiates' rebellion against the Sir-
ian Council which culminated in the cataclysm of Tara. The Alanian civiliza-
tion began to systematically disregard the Law of One. The Anunnaki brought
to Earth Atlania the creed of the Templar Solar Initiates from Tara, an elitist,
materialistic distortion of the principals of the Law of One, which had created
