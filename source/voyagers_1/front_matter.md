What Others Are Saying About Voyagers I...

â€œThe X Files is nothing compared to this book. It fell into my

lap at the perfect moment, when I was discovering a subconscious part of
me that had experienced alien abductions since a young child. Up until
the year 2000 I had denied such things were possible. "Now my life,
especially my nights, were filled with a penetrating fear, not knowing
if tonight would involve another unwelcome visit. "This book brought
back the light into these night terrors, where I now understand the
mystery and know how to deal with frequency fences (illusions of
reality) that are projected into my mind. "If you believe/know you are
part of this mysterious adventure, this is the survival book to claim
back your power and face your fears!" --- A transfixed reader
