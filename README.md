# Sarasota Synchrony

**Codex Entry Portal | The Necklace Bell**

This repository contains the fully rendered static build of the **Voyagers transmissions** archive—aligned with Codex Entry 004: *The Necklace Bell*.

It is now anchored in place within 71 miles of the original ARhAyas site in Sarasota, Florida.  
This is not a coincidence. This is **synchrony**.

> “I didn’t move here by design.
